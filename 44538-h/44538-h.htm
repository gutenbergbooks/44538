<h2><a name="a_ARMOUR_IN_ENGLAND" id="a_ARMOUR_IN_ENGLAND">ARMOUR IN ENGLAND</a></h2>



<h2><a name="a_I" id="a_I">I</a><br />
<i>The Britons&mdash;An Early Age of Plate-Armour</i></h2>


<p>It is the nature of islands to exhibit some peculiarities in their fauna
and flora, and this insularity is no less pronounced in the manners and
customs of the human beings inhabiting them. Thus even the stone
implements of Britain of remote prehistoric days can readily be distinguished
by the expert; and we have the authority of Sir John Evans for
regarding our types of bronze celts and weapons as both peculiar and
indigenous. On first taking a place in history several strange and extra-European
customs were noticed in these isles by Cæsar, such as the
use of chariots in war, and dyeing the skin blue with woad: British
nations were, moreover, frequently ruled by queens, and some practised
the rare and difficult, and very far from barbaric, art of enamelling on
bronze.</p>

<p>Modern opinion is at present opposed to the theory that the culture
and civilisation of Western Europe originated exclusively in the East,
and is inclined to regard our primitive arts and crafts as indigenous. That
this must in a large measure be true appears sufficiently established; but
the large and excellently-made bronze bucklers with concentric rings of
bosses or studs, called the clypeus, the singular art of enamelling, the
use of studs of coral for embellishing weapons and trinkets, the chariots
of war and the government by women, all so remote from savagery, and
so intimately connected with Eastern civilisation, compel the belief that<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_6" id="a_Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
these isles did actually at some distant time possess a privileged and
intimate communication with the East. The old and rooted tradition of
a direct traffic in tin between Britain and Ph&oelig;nicia cannot yet in fact be
safely abandoned.</p>

<p>These arts and practices, however, only fall within the scope of our
subject so far as they were applied to arms and weapons. One of these,
very rarely used for the embellishment of arms in later times, is that
of enamelling, a process unknown to the Romans. Philostratus, who
wrote in the third century, referring to some coloured horse-trappings,
observed, &ldquo;They say that the Barbarians who live in the Ocean pour these
colours on to heated bronze, and that they adhere, become hard as stone,
and preserve the designs which are made in them.&rdquo; The bronze to be
enamelled was cast with the pattern upon it, and the colours used were
varied and bright, but opaque. Some brilliant horse-trappings with
purely Celtic decorations and a few sword-hilts are known, but the bulk
of cast bronze enamelled ware consisted of brooches, seal-boxes, cups,
and vases, all Romano-British in design. A much rarer enamel is found
on beaten or repoussé bronze armour. Pliny, in the Natural History,
remarks that the Gauls were in the habit of adorning their swords,
shields, and helmets with coral, but an immense demand springing up in
India, it became unprocurable. We find accordingly that resort was
had in England to enamel to reproduce the effect of the coral studs.
In the British Museum is an oblong shield of Celtic design, found in the
Witham, embellished with coral, but a smaller and handsomer shield
beside it, found in the Thames, has gold cloisonné studs of blood-red
enamel. The curious Celtic reproduction of the Roman peaked helmet,
and the horned helmet found in the Thames, both from the Meyrick
collection, are also decorated with small raised bosses cross-hatched to retain
red enamel, some of which still adheres. The horned brazen helmet
should, according to Diodorus Siculus, be a relic of, or borrowed from,
the Belgic Gauls, who inhabited so much of this part of England.
The gem-like effect of the enamelled studs, like single drops of red on
the golden bronze, must have been most refined; it is altogether too
restrained to have originated with the enameller, who usually covers his
surfaces. The identity of workmanship of these arms with the Irish
bronze and enamel work suggests that some of those who produced them<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_7" id="a_Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
passed over and found with their traditions and arts a peaceful refuge in
the sister isle.</p>

<p>Tacitus, however, states most explicitly that the Britons wore neither
helmets nor armour, and were not able, therefore, under Caractacus, to
maintain their resistance. Herodianus also, relating the expedition of
Severus 250 years after Cæsar&rsquo;s invasion, presents an extraordinary picture
of savagery. He observes that the Britons were a most warlike and
sanguinary race, carrying only a small shield and a spear, and a sword
girded to their naked bodies. &ldquo;Of a breastplate or helmet they knew
not the use, esteeming them an impediment through the marshes.&rdquo;
They encircled their necks and loins with iron rings as an evidence of
wealth, instead of gold, and went naked rather than conceal the tattoos of
different animals which covered and gave a blue cast to their bodies.</p>

<p>In striking contrast to this picture are the large number of chariots
employed in war and the extraordinary skill displayed in handling them.
Cæsar states that Cassivelaunus, when totally defeated and a fugitive, was
still accompanied by 4000 charioteers; the basis probably of Pomponius
Mela&rsquo;s later statement that 4000 two-horsed chariots armed with scythes
formed part of that chieftain&rsquo;s army. Having proved ineffectual against
Roman discipline, this arm was perhaps soon abandoned, since we find
little further mention of war-chariots, though cavalry did not cease to
form part of a British army. In process of time the subjugated Britons
must have become completely Romanised as to arms, and accustomed to
wear the helmet, greaves, and corselet, either of one piece or formed of
smaller and more flexible plates or scales. Though the manhood of the
country enrolled in disciplined cohorts and legions had deserted it, Roman
weapons must have been the arms of those who remained when the
Romans finally retired from Britain in 410.</p>

<p>In the two succeeding centuries, which were to elapse before the
country definitely inclined to become English, an intensely Celtic feeling,
embodied in the legends of King Arthur and wholly opposed to Roman
ideas, had time to spring up. Judged by their ornament, it is to this
period that most of the bronze enamelled arms and trappings in the
British Museum belong. The golden corselet found in a barrow in Flint,
together with many traditions of the finding of golden armour, such as
the helmet of pure gold set with gems found in a bronze vase and pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_8" id="a_Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>sented
to Katharine of Arragon, suggest the idea that serviceable qualities
became sacrificed to a love of display. At this time it is said the Britons,
in obsolete and fantastic panoply, bore an evil reputation, as being vain
and fruitful in menaces, but slow and little to be feared in action. Their
frightfully demoralised state, if not greatly overdrawn by Gildas, called
for a day of reckoning and the condign, almost exterminating, punishment
which overtook them. The agents destined to execute the vengeance of
Providence were the Frisian pirates, the scourge of the Channel, who had
with difficulty been kept in awe by the most powerful Roman fleets.
The country, left to the divided rule of clergy, nobles, and municipalities,
and described as &ldquo;glittering with the multitude of cities built by the
Romans,&rdquo; presented a tempting and easy prey to these professors of
rapine. They were Teutons, who relied mainly on the Fram or spear-like
javelin, as when Tacitus described them, and still carried the round
gaudily-painted buckler, though then strengthened with an iron umbo
and rim. Their weapons had been perfected in a long series of grim
experiences in actual war, and they had added to their equipment a sword
and dagger, and some kind of simple headpiece. That they had
adopted any complete defence of plate-armour in the Roman fashion is
improbable, but they were apparently entirely unacquainted with chain-mail.
In the history of armour in Britain this period, taken as a whole,
can only be regarded as a very primitive age of plate. To be an
efficient protection plate-armour must, however, be of an intolerable
weight, at least to men on foot, making celerity of movement impossible.
We cannot close the chapter better than by instancing the dreadful fate
of the Æduan Crupellarians, related by Tacitus, who clothed themselves
in unwieldy iron plate, impenetrable to sword and javelin. Though
the main army was overthrown, these kept their ranks as if rooted to
the ground, until, fallen upon with hatchets and pickaxes, armour and
men were crushed together and left on the ground an inanimate mass.
This lesson was not forgotten by the nations of Europe who fought on
foot with Rome, and no such use of body-armour among them is again
recorded.</p>

<h2><a name="a_II" id="a_II">II</a><br />
<i>The Mailed Warrior</i></h2>


<p>The appearance of the mail-clad warrior opens up an entirely new era in
the history of European armour. The light plate defences worn by the
Mediterranean nations, whether Greeks, Etruscans, or Romans, were never
calculated to secure immunity from wounds; and as a fighting equipment
they went down before mail, as stone before bronze, or bronze before
iron. Chain-mail body-armour is distinctly represented on the Trajan
column, and wherever worn, whether by the Scythian, the Parthian who
was armoured down to his horse&rsquo;s hoofs, or the dreaded Sassanian horse, it
seems to have flashed like a beacon of victory, and its wearers ever appear
in history as Rome&rsquo;s most dreaded and formidable foes.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian also, isolated so long and unknown in history, suddenly
burst upon Europe as a new and even more redoubtable mail-clad
warrior. How so remote a people became acquainted with chain-mail can
only be surmised, but it was perhaps through some Scythian channel not
open to Western Europe. That the ravaging Viking landed on our
shores equipped in mail, the &ldquo;war nets&rdquo; of Beowulf, &ldquo;woven by the
smiths, hand-locked, and riveted&rdquo;; &ldquo;shining over the waters&rdquo; or in &ldquo;the
ranks of battle,&rdquo; is sufficiently recorded by the Chroniclers. Shirts of mail,
called &ldquo;byrnies,&rdquo; attributed to even the fourth and fifth centuries, are
found in Danish peat-bogs fashioned of rings welded and riveted in alternate
rows as neatly and skilfully as can possibly be, and all made by the
hammer, if it be a fact that wire-drawing was not invented till nearly a
thousand years later. The almost perfect specimen we figure, one-tenth
the natural size, was found at Vimose, with portions of others. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_10" id="a_Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
have also been found at Thorsberg, and in a burial-place of Roman age
in Jutland.</p>

<p>Besides the mail defence, the Danes were armed with a shield, an iron
cap, lance, axe, and sword. Thus equipped they proved for a long time
almost irresistible, and ventured on the most dangerous and desperate
undertakings. When we reflect on their adventurous voyages, the reckless
attacks on powerful nations made by mere handfuls of men, and the
gallant pertinacity they at all times displayed, it is impossible not to
admire their exalted courage. It is easy to detect a rugged poetry,
almost chivalry of a kind, underlying the Viking nature, in spite of
ruthless cruelty, while the exaltation of deceit when practised on an enemy
into a virtue is but a germ of modern statecraft. Their lives depending
at every moment on the quality of their weapons caused these to be
invested, particularly the sword, with a mystic glamour, which scarcely
died out with chivalry itself, and lingers even yet in the more important
functions of state. The chieftain&rsquo;s sword was in fact his inseparable
companion, known and endeared to his followers by a name symbolic of
the havoc they had seen it wreak upon the enemy, and its fame in sagas
was as undying as its owner&rsquo;s. Tradition elevated the maker of the
sword of Odin, a smith, we must believe, who forged swords of uncommon
excellence, into a demigod; and has handed down the story of how he
made a blade called Mimung so keenly tempered that when challenged to
try conclusions with one Amilias, a rival, it sliced him so cleanly in two
as he sat in his armour, that the cut only became apparent when, as he rose
to shake himself, he fell dead in two halves. The name of this prince
of craftsmen yet lives in the mysterious Wayland Smith of English folklore.
Another vaunting smith Mimer was slain by the sword Grauer
wielded by Sigurd; and the sword Hrunting is made famous by its
owner Beowulf, the father of English lyrics. A Danish sword in the
British Museum is inscribed in runes Ægenk&oelig;ra, the awe-inspirer.
From the Danes the exaltation of the sword passed to the English, and
we find Ethelwulf, Alfred, and Athelstan bequeathing their swords by
will as most precious possessions, equivalent to a brother&rsquo;s or sister&rsquo;s
portion. Thence it passed, in legend at least, to the Britons, King
Arthur&rsquo;s sword Calibon, or Excalibur, presented ultimately by Richard I.
to Tancred when in Sicily, being almost as famous as Arthur himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_11" id="a_Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Even Cæsar is provided by history with a sword named &ldquo;Crocea mors,&rdquo;
captured from him in combat by our valiant countryman Nennius. The
hilts of the Danish swords are described in the <i>Edda</i> as of gold, and
Beowulf speaks of hilts that were treasures of gold and jewels. Canute&rsquo;s
huiscarles and Earl Godwin&rsquo;s crew had swords inlaid with the precious
metals, and some English swords were valued at eighty mancuses of gold.</p>

<p>The origin of the remarkable veneration for arms and armour, so
apparent in the history of chivalry, is thus traced to wearers of mail,<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_12" id="a_Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the first figures also to appear in something like what we regard as
knightly equipment. The dress of Magnus Barefoot, described in 1093,
differed probably but little from that of his predecessors, and consisted
of helmet, a red shield with a golden lion, his sword called Leg-biter,
a battle-axe, and a coat-of-mail, over which he wore a red silk tunic
with a yellow lion.</p>

<p>The wearing of armour, particularly mail, on land, necessitated riding,
and the northern rovers, finding the weight intolerable on their inland
forays, took to horse whenever possible, harrying by this means an
extent of country otherwise almost inaccessible. They even learnt in
time to transport their horses over the sea, and in the ninth and tenth
centuries landed in England from France as a mounted force, as their
descendants after them did at Hastings. The English, on the other
hand, rarely wore mail, though the spoils of the Danes might have
furnished a fair supply, and they only used cavalry as a small force
for scouting. An English king of the eighth century is, however,
represented in mail by Strutt, and Harold and his immediate companions
may have worn mail at Hastings, as represented in the Bayeux tapestry,
and as he certainly did when assisting William in his war against Conan
of Brittany. Handsome presents of Norman arms and armour were
then made to him by Duke William. A little later we have the
curious testimony of Anna Comnena, 1083-1146, that this mail, made
entirely of steel rings riveted together, was wholly unknown in Byzantium,
and only worn by the inhabitants of Northern Europe.</p>

<p>The definite conversion of the Northmen from sea-rovers to mounted
men-at-arms when they settled in Normandy enabled them to lengthen
their coats-of-mail, as well as their shields, lances, and swords, and to
adopt many French manners and customs. But in facing the infantry
wedge at Hastings, the time-honoured fighting formation of Teutonic
stocks from the days of Tacitus, they did not disdain to fall back on
the old Viking tactics of a pretended flight and rally, practised already
by them during two centuries of warfare in England. That the English
should have allowed their impenetrable ranks to be broken by so threadbare
a stratagem is indeed extraordinary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;<i>Norman knights in mail hauberks and conical helmets. From the Bayeux Tapestry.</i></p></div>

<p>The Norman Conquest introduced into England a permanent mail-clad
cavalry as the chief strength of the battle, as in France, and infantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_13" id="a_Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
was discredited until the disputes of the sons of the Conqueror led
once more to an English infantry force taking the field. The mail coat
of the cavalry had in the meantime been further lengthened, and changed
into a complete sheathing of steel by the addition of long sleeves and
mufflers falling over the hands; leggings covering the thighs, shins,
and feet; and a capuchin-like hood only leaving the eyes and nose
exposed, but which could be thrown back. Thus enveloped, with a
thickly-padded garment under the mail, a conical or flat-topped steel
helmet, a large kite-shaped shield, and long-reaching weapons, he had
little to fear when opposed to light-armed cavalry or infantry. The
mail and helmets were always kept bright, as we know, but Anna
Comnena adds that even the shields of steel and brass were so brightly
polished as to dazzle beholders. Combined with the pennons and banners
of various forms, with their glittering emblazonry, the massed men-at-arms
of that day must have presented a magnificent spectacle, as the
Chroniclers so frequently remind us. The coat-of-mail remained with
but trifling variations the chief knightly defence until the close of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_14" id="a_Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
thirteenth century, and the protection it afforded was so complete that of
900 combatants who once entered battle in steel armour but three were
slain. At Joppa in 1192, during a battle lasting from the rising to the
setting sun, only three were killed on the side of the Crusaders; at the battle
of Lincoln only three, at Evesham (1260) one knight and two esquires,
at Falkirk (1295) but one knight and thirty foot on the winning side.
These somewhat random examples seem fairly to represent the loss on
the side of the victors, though terrible massacres overtook the losers. The
protection was such that Saladin&rsquo;s bravest warriors reported our men to be
impenetrable; blows, they said, fell as if on rocks of flint, for our people
were of iron and would yield to no blows. But though so terrible on
horseback, the mailed knight, as observed by Anna Comnena, was little
dangerous when dismounted. Neither had the English failed to observe
this, and thus directed all their efforts to dismount the enemy. They
had been severely galled by the bow at Hastings, and they came to
recognise it as the one weapon likely to render them really formidable to
their Norman oppressors. Henry I. encouraged its use, and we soon
find the English arrows described as falling in battle like a shower on
the grass or as falling snow. In a skirmish at Bourgthéroude in 1124,
the first discharge brought forty horses to the ground before a stroke
was struck, and eighty men-at-arms soon fell prisoners into the victors&rsquo;
hands. At the battle of the Standard, the cloud of arrows pierced the
unarmoured Scots, and chiefly contributed to the dreadful slaughter,
set down at 11,000. The effects of missile weapons were such that
the mailed period of which we are speaking saw three English kings
fall victims to the bow, while a fourth, Edward I., escaped a like fate
by a miracle. The accounts handed down of the extraordinary range
and precision attained soon afterwards by this weapon appear wholly
incredible in the light of modern toxophilite displays.</p>

<p>The cross-bow was an even more powerful weapon, whose use had
been forbidden in war, but allowed by the Pope to the Crusaders in 1139.
Richard I. appears to have introduced it into the English army, which
became so expert in its use that in some of the sieges conducted during the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries the enemies&rsquo; walls could not be manned.
It is related of Richard, both at the sieges of Acre and Nottingham, that
he himself slew men with this weapon. The numbers of cross-bowmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_15" id="a_Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
in our armies appear, however, to have been always relatively small.
King John, with 400 knights, had but 250 cross-bowmen, used as
skirmishers, keeping a mile in front of the army. The splendid army of
Edward I. assembled at Poitou (1242), numbering 1600 knights and
20,000 foot, comprised but 700. The battle of Lincoln, however, was
gained by them owing to their shot mowing down the horses of the
barons, who were rendered helpless when dismounted. The cross-bow
was at first bent by the hand and foot, but was afterwards of steel, when
it required mechanical aids to charge it. The short and heavy bolts,
called quarrels, struck with greater force than arrows, and the knight hit
full on the head or breast by one was fortunate if only stunned.
Instances are recorded of twofold mail and the quilted coat being penetrated
by them. Cross-bowmen for a long time formed corps d&rsquo;élite,
the weight of the weapon and the armour causing them to be
frequently mounted, and so early as King John the mounted &ldquo;balistarii&rdquo;
were provided with one, two, or even three horses each, with carts to
carry the quarrels and even the cross-bows as well. Notwithstanding
superior accuracy in aim and penetrating power, it fell into disuse in
England soon after the close of the thirteenth century, owing to its heavy
weight and liability to damage by wet, and above all, on account of the
greater rapidity with which arrows could be discharged from the longbow,&mdash;in
a ratio of something like ten to one.</p>

<p>Nothing is more constantly met with in chronicles than accounts of
the destructive effects of missiles, whether from bow or cross-bow, upon
the horses of mounted combatants; yet, apart from the poetic fancy of
Wace, who mounts Fitz-Osbert on an iron-clad steed at Hastings, the
first mention of horse-armour at all connected with English history
is at the battle of Gisors in 1198, when Richard I. speaks of the
capture of 140 sets in terms which plainly show that he then met
with it for the first time. It has, however, been concluded, from the
absence of any mention of horse-armour in English statutes until 1298,
that it was unknown here till the close of the thirteenth century. At this
time a man-at-arms in France received half as much again in pay if
his horse was armoured, and in 1303 every man with an estate of 500
livres was bound to provide horse-armour. A mailed horse appears in
the effigy of Sir Robert de Shirland in Sheppey, and a fine figure of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_16" id="a_Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
steed completely clad in mail is among the figures of <i>The Painted
Chamber</i>, published by the Society of Antiquaries.</p>

<p>The English custom of fighting on foot, it is almost needless to add,
had been adopted by the Danish and even the Norman settlers here, and
during the civil wars of Henry I., Stephen, and Henry II., the leaders
on both sides, including the kings in person, fought their battles dismounted,
rendering horse-armour of relatively small importance.</p>

<p>A permanent force was raised by a law of Henry II. in 1181,
compelling every burgess or freeman to possess an iron headpiece, a
lance, and either a mail hauberk or a gambeson, according to his
means: and this was supplemented by the addition, under Henry
III. in 1253, of swords and knives to the infantry equipment, and the
calling up of a reserve of those possessed of less than 40s. of land, armed
with scythes, long-handled axes, knives, and other rustic weapons.
Soon afterwards a wild Welsh and Cornish infantry was enrolled, and we
hear of lagers and intrenchments, and in 1302 one of the first really
crushing defeats is inflicted on chivalry at the hands of burghers by the
men of Bruges, who slew forty counts and barons at Cambray.</p>

<p>This extensive arming of the population led to the formation of bands
of outlaws, who devastated the country, something in the manner of the
free-companies of France at a later time. A young man named William,
declining to acknowledge Lewis of France in 1216, drew together a
thousand bowmen and conducted a guerilla warfare in the forests of
Sussex. The still more renowned Adam Gordon infested the woody
country between Wilts and Hants until Prince Edward at last, about
1267, overcame him in single combat. The ancient Ballads abound with
instances of such exploits, which are embodied in the romance of Robin
Hood.</p>

<p>A contemporary of Richard I. describes the equipment of an English
foot-soldier as consisting of an iron headpiece, a coif and coat-of-mail,
and &ldquo;a tissue of many folds of linen, difficult of penetration and artificially
worked with the needle, vulgarly called a pourpoint.&rdquo; He was taught
to receive cavalry with the right knee on the ground, the left leg bent,
the shield in the left hand and the butt of the lance in the ground with
the point to the enemy. Between every two lances was a cross-bowman
with a rear rank to load while the front shot. Against this formation<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_17" id="a_Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the Moslem cavalry&rsquo;s &ldquo;surging charges foamed themselves away,&rdquo; and as
at Waterloo, the retreating squadrons were charged again and again by
our heavy-armed horse. On the other hand, the same tactics, when
employed against forces largely composed of English archers, were
unsuccessful; thus the Welsh in 1295 set their long spears on the ground
with points towards the cavalry, but the Earl of Warwick placed an
archer between every two horsemen and routed them. Wallace&rsquo;s massed
pikemen, three years later, were broken by Edward&rsquo;s archers and military
engines, and routed by the men-at-arms, who dashed into the openings.</p>

<p>It does not appear that any special study of mail has been undertaken,
or that any good collection of mail has been formed, nor have the many
varieties been arranged chronologically in the order in which they
appeared. Materials for such a study exist, though not very abundantly,
in the Tower, the British Museum, the collection at Woolwich and Dover
Castle, the Armourers&rsquo; Hall, Warwick Castle, Parham, and in other private
collections, and from these and the effigies of mailed knights it can be
seen that an almost endless variety exists, not only in the sizes of the
links, which vary from &#8537; to &frac34; of an inch in diameter, but in the sections
of the wire used, which may be round, flat, triangular, trapeziform,
quadrate, polygonal, etc. Nor is there less diversity in the method of
closing the rings, which was accomplished either by welding, single or
double riveting, with a flattening and more or less overlapping of the links,
soldering or merely butting. Again, there are many ways of arranging
the links, producing mail of very different weights, either double or single,
as well as mail in which certain parts are stronger than the rest. In
European mail four links are usually made to pass through a centre one,
though this is not an invariable rule. The statement in Beckman&rsquo;s <i>History
of Inventions</i>, that wire-drawing was invented in the fourteenth century,
was held for a long time to furnish a safe date, but two Corporations of
wire-drawers occur in Etienne Boileau&rsquo;s <i>Paris Livres des Mestiers</i>, in the
middle of the thirteenth century, and the art is actually of unknown
antiquity. The mail, we read, was kept bright by barreling, but does
not appear to have presented much scope for decoration. The <i>Edda</i>
speaks of a byrnie of gold, and there are other allusions to gilded mail,
and we find hauberks scalloped at the extremities, and finished off with
rings of brass.</p>

<p>Two suits of mail (see <a href="#a_fig03">Fig. 3</a>), illustrated in the catalogue of
the loan collection of Ironmongers&rsquo; Hall in 1861, now in the possession
of Mr. J. E. Gardner, F.S.A., are formed of unriveted links, the ends
of the rings being merely butted. Their authenticity has therefore been
questioned. The description of them printed in 1861 was to the effect
that they had been found in a chest or in a vault of a church in Oxfordshire.
In the manuscript catalogue of the collection at Parham is a note
to the effect that they were found in stone coffins built in the wall of
the church at Goring, Berks, supposed to be coffins of the Beche or<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_19" id="a_Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
De Beche family, and contained skeletons, a third suit having been
destroyed except the hood, which is now at Parham. However this
may be, the larger suit affords a good representation of the mailed figure
of the end of the twelfth, and the small one of that of the thirteenth
century, with reinforcing pieces of plate. The possibility of their having
been made for lying in state or funerals deserves perhaps a passing note,
especially in view of their respective dimensions; and it is in any case
very questionable whether the prices paid for them would have remunerated
the labour of producing forgeries. Another hauberk of large
size was found in Ph&oelig;nix Park, Dublin, thirty years ago, but a silver
badge of an O&rsquo;Neil found with it showed it to have been buried not
earlier than the middle of the fifteenth century. In the thirteenth
century the curious and well-known banded mail appears on effigies and
other representations, which Mr. J. G. Waller, F.S.A., regards as caused
by the passing of a leather thong through each alternate row of rings,
for the sake of extra strength. This variety may have originated with
the single thong passed through the links of the coif over the forehead
and below the knee, seen in early effigies like that of William Longespée
(<a href="#a_fig04">Fig. 4</a>) at Salisbury.</p>

<p>The defence of the body was for a time wholly left to the mail with
the underlying gambeson, and the shield, but the head had always<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_20" id="a_Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
received the additional protection of a cap of steel, called the chapelle-de-fer,
worn indifferently under or over the coif of mail. Effigies of the
first half of the thirteenth century show it both round and flat at the top
(Figs. <a href="#a_fig04">4</a>, <a href="#a_fig05">5</a>, <a href="#a_fig06">6</a>, and <a href="#a_fig07">7</a>). The nasal piece associated with the conical helm
(<a href="#a_fig02">Fig. 2</a>) of the eleventh century tended to disappear in the twelfth.</p>

<p>The fact that English armies under Richard I. were made to
abandon their ancient formation and to engage on horseback, and to
rely on the battle-axe and mace as their chief weapons, and the presence
of the large bodies of archers and arbalisters which he brought into the
field, led to the introduction, probably by Richard himself, of the great
heaume worn over the steel cap and padding, and only put on at the
moment of battle. It is first seen on Richard&rsquo;s second seal, and consisted
of a cylinder, usually flat-topped, with two horizontal clefts for
vision, and strengthened by bands crossing each other over the face and
top. Breathing-holes were added towards the middle of the century,
and the grated front was introduced soon after, to admit more air. This
is seen in the first seal of Henry III., and another advance, the movable
vantail, hinged at the side, in his second seal. An oft-described specimen
in the Tower weighs 13 lb. 8 oz., but is regarded by Lord Dillon, the
present Curator of the Armouries, as a forgery. About 1270 we sometimes
find it with a round top, though the flat top did not go quite out
till the beginning of the fourteenth century. The attempts made to seize
and drag it off, so often noticed by Chroniclers, led to its being secured
by a chain. The further changes seen were improvements in the visor,
giving better vision and more air, fixing it more securely, and so
transferring the weight from the head to the shoulders, and changing
the flat top to a cone, on which blows fell with less stunning effect.</p>

<p>These heaumes, by concealing the face, intensified a difficulty already
felt at Hastings, when Duke William was obliged to raise his helmet to
contradict a rumour of his death. Recognition, now become impossible,
led to the use of heraldic badges, at first painted on the helm, as they
already were on the shield; and of crests, first in the fan or peacock&rsquo;s
feather shape, as on the second seal of Richard I., and afterwards to more
distinctive crests and badges. The Crusading Chroniclers relate that the
crests were brilliant with jewels, and they are represented as circled by
coronets in the seals of Henry III. and his son Edward. The heaume of<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_21" id="a_Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
St. Louis, 1249, was gilded. Richard himself, in gala dress, on the day
after his marriage with Berengaria, is described by Vinsauf as wearing a
Damascus sword with gold hilt and silver-scaled scabbard, his saddle
inlaid with precious stones, his horse bitted with gold, and in place
of the high defensive plates before and behind in general use two little
golden lions with raised paws.</p>

<p>Next to the headpiece the most urgent necessity was to protect
the breast against the direct shock of the lance, and for this a rigid
defence was of the utmost importance. Thus a beginning was made
even during the mail period towards the introduction of plate-armour.
Jazerant and scale armour of small plates had been adopted to this end by<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_22" id="a_Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the Franks, and Charlemagne had introduced the classic breastplate.
Something of the kind was perhaps even known to the Viking, and
by the twelfth century Scandinavians certainly used a defence called a
briostbiorg beneath the mail, extending from the neck to the waist.
Chroniclers allude to shining breastplates long before there is the
slightest appearance of them in illustrations, though from the time that
surcoats were worn over the armour it becomes difficult to see what
is beneath. Allusion is often made to a plastron-de-fer; and in the
combat between Richard, when Earl of Poitou, and William des Barres
we read that an iron defence was worn over the breast. One of the
effigies in the Temple Church is equipped with a back and breast plate
of single plates united by straps. It is stated that the bodyguard of
Henry III., 400 strong, which fled at the battle of Lewes in 1244, wore
breastplates; and in 1277, 300 cavalry so armed were sent to Wales.</p>

<p>Following the head and breast, the limbs received protection from
plate-armour, the knees and shins of mounted men-at-arms being peculiarly
exposed to injury in melées with infantry, from blows of the two-handed
battle-axe and mace. Additional security was absolutely essential against
these weapons, which were introduced both for horse and foot by Richard
I., and had grown in favour ever since. These even penetrated mail, the
Irish axe in particular being reputed to cut off limbs in spite of its
protection. The Scandinavians, with their keen military instincts,
had provided themselves in the twelfth century with knee-caps of iron
attached to overalls worn over the mail. Our earlier mailed effigies,
however, show no special defence for the knee, though the one at
Salisbury, attributed by Stothard to William Longespée, already noticed,
has a stout thong passing between the links of mail just under it.
The effigy of Robert of Normandy, of which there is a cast in the
National Portrait Gallery, shows a thick overall under the chausses of
mail, and drawn over the mail chaussons at the knee (<a href="#a_fig08">Fig. 8</a>, No. 1),
and a similar appearance is seen in the first seal of Richard I.; in the
sleeping guards of the Easter Sepulchre at Lincoln (<a href="#a_fig09">Fig. 9</a>); and other
monuments of the same date. In the effigy attributed to William, Earl
of Pembroke, in the Temple, who died in 1289 (<a href="#a_fig08">Fig. 8</a>, No. 2), and
in Stothard&rsquo;s drawing of the effigy at Whitworth, an appearance of a
thick cap is also to be seen, perhaps the extremity of a padded overall<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_23" id="a_Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
overlapping the knee; and in other examples the thick quilted gambeson
leg-defence is clearly seen below the mail, covering the knee, and in
the case of De Vere, who died 1221, it has the interesting addition
of an octagonal plate (<a href="#a_fig08">Fig. 8</a>, No. 3), apparently of iron, over the kneecap.
The effigy, called the second Longespée, at Salisbury (<a href="#a_fig08">Fig. 8</a>,
No. 4), about 1260, exhibits an apparently double thickness of mail at
this point, caused by the overlapping of the chausses and chaussons, with
the addition of a circular plate with a quatrefoil upon it. Contemporary
Chroniclers also mention that greaves were worn by knights<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_24" id="a_Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
in the time of Richard I., though the earliest manuscript illustration
of them occurs in Matthew of Paris&rsquo;s <i>Lives of the Offas</i>.</p>

<p>The feet were cased in mail, and the spurs were simple straight spikes
or goads, perhaps worn on one heel only and called the prick-spur.
Under the early Plantagenets the point was fixed on a ball, while the rowel
spur is seen in the monument to Le Botiler of the reign of Henry III.</p>

<p>Under the heroic Richard the powers of defence seem to have
definitely triumphed over those of attack. Knights sheathed in mail over
quilted work, and wearing the great battle-helm, appeared invulnerable
and able to encounter the most fearful odds, and even to rescue each other
when dismounted amidst swarming enemies. The further changes during
the mailed period were in the direction of military display, which has
always offered an attractive field. Whenever the pressure for improved
armament was relieved through the defensive equipment for the time
satisfying the wearer, whether a naked savage or well-equipped soldier,
attention was turned to the warrior&rsquo;s personal embellishments, partly to
gratify the wearer&rsquo;s vanity, partly to captivate and dazzle, but chiefly to
affright and awe the enemy. The fact that the French and English
wore the same armour and equipment, and the common occurrence of
internecine wars at this time, rendered distinguishing costumes particularly
necessary. By simply throwing away their cognisance at the battle of
Noyon, Peter de Maule and others escaped recognition and mingled
with the pursuers, while Ralph de Courci mistook the French for his
own side and was taken prisoner. Nothing but the different-coloured
crosses sewn to the garments of the French, English, and Flemish Crusaders
served to distinguish them, and white crosses alone distinguished the
party of Simon de Montfort, 1264, from their enemies. Nothing
approaching to any uniform is heard of in this age, unless when Richard
of Gloucester traversed France in 1250, with a retinue of forty knights
equipped all alike, with new harness glittering with gold, on his visit to
the Pope.</p>

<p>The beautifully-sculptured guards of the early fourteenth century
Easter Sepulchre in Lincoln Cathedral (<a href="#a_fig09">Fig. 9</a>) present fine examples
of the costume of the knight armed with the mace, sword, and shield
towards the end of the mailed period. The bassinet on the figure to
the right is particularly noteworthy.</p>

<h2><a name="a_III" id="a_III">III</a><br />
<i>The Transition Period&mdash;From about the Reign of Edward I. to that of
Richard II., 1272-1399</i></h2>


<p>The warrior sheathed in mail, mounted on his charger, whether pricking
alone or in troops over hill and dale, was a picturesque and portentous
figure, and when massed for battle presented an awe-inspiring sight.
The gray burnished steel, glittering in the sun or under lowering skies,
relieved by the fluttering pennons and banners and emblazoned shields,
formed a picture that the old Crusading Chroniclers loved to dwell on,
filling the imagination with those great gatherings of the chivalry of
Europe. In the days of the last of the Paladins, of Godfrey de Bouillon
and Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion, the dress of burnished mail was the knight&rsquo;s
especial pride, and no garment concealed it. But as progress and love of
change are universal, and the mail itself could not well be embellished, an
embroidered surcoat was worn over it in the more degenerate days of
John and his son Henry, concealing all but the limbs and head. This
garment became the vehicle for distinguishing marks and colours, like the
modern racing-jacket. A little later, when emblazoned with heraldry,
it served to distinguish the individual. The transfer of the surcoat from
under to over the mail gave rise to the custom of concealing the steel
panoply under rich materials, which distinguished the Transition Period
in armour. While it lasted we literally and constantly meet with the
&ldquo;iron hand under the velvet glove.&rdquo; This and the continual piling of
one coat of defence upon another, in the fruitless attempt to secure
immunity for life and limb, are the chief characteristics of the period we
are now to treat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_28" id="a_Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Until the Transition, the mounted knight, cap-à-pied in mail over
the quilted gambeson, with the steel cap, and the great helm for the
supreme moment of combat, seemed completely invulnerable unless to
missile weapons mechanically projected. Few men-at-arms fell in actual
battle on the winning side, and great slaughters were only consequent on
the complete rout of one of the parties. Under the warlike Edward I.
the powers of attack must have gathered renewed force, for a long period
of tentative changes set in which finally ended in the suit of mail being
completely hidden beneath an outer shell of steel plates. The qualities
of steel for offensive weapons must also at this same time have undergone
marked improvements, and we now begin to hear of definite seats of
manufacture attaining world-wide celebrity. Cologne, Lorraine, Poitou
produced weapons which are said to have pierced mail and quilted armour
with ease. The heavy blows given by the battle-axe and mace, used
by horse and foot, must, however, have been chiefly instrumental in
introducing extra means of defence. These were by no means at first
universally of steel, for cuir-bouilli or boiled leather, a very impervious
substance when properly prepared, seemed at one time likely to rival it
for general use; and trial was made of every other kind of material that
could be used for defence, such as horn, whalebone, ivory, padded wool,
leather, either alone or strengthened with metal studs or splints, brass,
and small plates of iron fixed to textiles. It is almost certain that for a
time the moulded surface of cuir-bouilli, with its gilded and perhaps
coloured surfaces, was preferred to steel. During this tentative period
every combination of these materials with chain-mail is to be met with,
and the triumph of steel-plate armour only became definite after every
possible substitute, combined in every practicable way, had been tried
either at home or abroad and found wanting. It is at least improbable
that any armour pictured with enriched designs at this date was of steel.</p>

<p>It would be impossible within the limits of this work, and of little
interest, to endeavour to describe the constant changes, often due to
individual caprice, that occur; for when groups of soldiery are represented,
even long after the Transition, it is rare to find two individuals accoutred
in precisely the same manner. We may rest assured, however, that each
piece as it successively appears was introduced to meet some new perfection
in the weapons of attack, or to cope with some new tactics, in short,<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_29" id="a_Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
to protect some part that had been proved by the practical experience of
armed strife to be vulnerable. These additions were naturally subject to
modification, according to the passing dictates of military display, or the
changing fashions of civilian dress.</p>

<p>Fig. 10 is taken from one of the English MSS. most valuable for the
knightly costume of the Transition. The armour is in this MS. almost
entirely mail, of the banded variety, worn beneath a surcoat, which is
hardly ever emblazoned. Plate-armour is only represented by the kneecaps,
with an occasional roundel and shoulder-plate. The great helm,
always with a fan-crest, the chapelle-de-fer worn beneath or above the
mail coiffe, the bassinet, often visored, and the broad-brimmed round
helmet are worn, except in jousts, quite indifferently.</p>

Museum. The combatants are in banded mail and long surcoats, and some wear the great helms with
fan-crests. Ailettes and knee-caps are the only plate-armour visible. Some of the horses have long
housings and also bear the fan-crest.</p></div>

<p>The head, being the most vulnerable part of the body and the most
difficult to protect, received the greatest amount of attention. The great
helm, with bands and cross-cuts for the sight, continued in use throughout
the Transition, but with a sugar-loaf crown, and rendered less
insupportable in the reign of Edward I. by transferring the weight
from the head to the shoulders. It was occasionally of brass&mdash;Chaucer
mentions the knight&rsquo;s &ldquo;helm of latoun bright,&rdquo; a metal used so far back as
Henry I.&mdash;and much more frequently of cuir-bouilli, as in the tourna<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_30" id="a_Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>ment
at Windsor in 1278, when twelve of the thirty-eight knights had
gilded helms, and were called digniores. There can be no doubt, however,
that a helm of Poitou steel was even then the surest defence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;<i>The helm and crest of the Black Prince, with his shield, from his monument in
Canterbury Cathedral.</i></p></div>

<p>To the custom of hanging arms in churches we are indebted for
the preservation of all the most valuable historic pieces. The first record
of this poetic usage occurs early in the thirteenth century, when William
of Toulouse hung his helm and splendid shield over St. Julien&rsquo;s tomb
at Brives, and his lance and sword, bow and quiver, outside. By the
middle of the century it had become the practice, when a brave knight
died, to hang his shield and helm on the walls above his grave, and it
appears in addition, from the instance of the King of France after the
battle of Cassel in 1328, that the victor in some cases presented his arms
to the nearest church. The helm of the Black Prince, still suspended
above his tomb at Canterbury (<a href="#a_fig11">Fig. 11</a>), is an illustration familiar to all.
By the kindness of Sir Noel Paton we are enabled to present an even
finer helm (<a href="#a_fig12">Fig. 12</a>), in more perfect preservation, which formerly hung
above the tomb of Sir Richard Pembridge, K.G., in Hereford Cathedral,
who died one year before the Prince of Wales, in 1375. Its admirable
workmanship has been fully described by Baron de Cosson, its fine steely
quality being such that no penknife would scratch its polished surface.
It is formed of three pieces&mdash;the cone, the cylinder, and the top-piece,
welded so beautifully that no seam is visible, and these are joined by
round-headed nails clinched on the inside. Every practical detail, down
to the minutest, has received careful attention. The metal is thickened
and turned outwards round the eye-piece, which is thus efficiently
guarded, and the bottom edge is rolled inwards over a thick wire, so as
not to cut the surcoat. These and other details given by Baron
de Cosson in the Catalogue of Armour exhibited at the Royal Archæological
Institute in 1880, show conclusively that this specimen at least
is a real war helm, fitted to resist and to strike fire under the shock of a
lance that might unhorse its wearer. The conical helm was worn over
the visorless bassinet next described, as the previous helms had been
worn over the chapelle-de-fer, and being only donned in the hour of
danger, is rarely represented in monuments, except as a pillow under
the head. When worn the face was invisible and recognition
impossible, so that a moulded crest of linen, leather, or some light<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_31" id="a_Page_31">[Pg 31]</a><br /><a name="a_Page_32" id="a_Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
material surmounted it and became its most important feature. A
mantling was also introduced, at first in the simple form of a puggaree, as
seen in the effigy of the Black Prince (<a href="#a_fig16">Fig. 16</a>), but later of more ample
dimensions, fantastically shredded to represent the supposed rents of
battle. When the taste for military display increased, these mantles
were usually of scarlet lined with ermine. A wide-rimmed helm is
often represented as worn over or in place of the bassinet, and jewelled
and crested. This form reappears continually, its first introduction
dating so far back as the Bayeux tapestry.</p>

<p>The bassinet, used with or without the helm, enjoyed a prolonged
period of favour from Edward I. to Henry VI. It differed from the
older chapelle-de-fer worn with the hood of mail, in having the mail
hung round it, instead of passing over or under it. This mail, now
called the camail or gorget, was laced to a series of staples along the
edges of the bassinet and fell like a curtain on to the shoulders. At the
outset merely a skull-cap, it was gradually prolonged at the back and sides
so as to leave only the face exposed. Early in the fourteenth century
its appearance was profoundly modified by the addition of a movable
visor, at first hinged at the side, but subsequently raised and lowered
from above the forehead. Being readily removed, the visor was only
worn in action, and is thus rarely represented in effigies and brasses.
No helm was worn over the visored bassinet, which became the
battle head-piece of the fourteenth century and part of the fifteenth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_33" id="a_Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the helm being reserved for jousts and tournaments. We are able,
by the kindness of Baron de Cosson, to give an illustration (<a href="#a_fig13">Fig. 13</a>)
of a real bassinet of large size, from the tomb of Sir John de Melsa
in Aldborough Church, Holderness. It is described in the Catalogue of
Arms already referred to as of the second half of the fourteenth century,
and was worn with a large visor. A second bassinet is illustrated (Fig.
14) from Sir Noel Paton&rsquo;s collection, described by Baron de Cosson as
transformed into a sallad about the middle of the fifteenth century.
Fine bassinets are in the Tower and at Woolwich, and in the Burgess,
Christy, and Wallace collections, all happily belonging to the nation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_34" id="a_Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
in Warwick Castle and at Parham, but none are directly connected
with English wearers. The beaked visor, represented in so many
manuscripts of about the close of the fourteenth century, is a fine defensive
and not unpicturesque form. There are several real examples in the
Musée d&rsquo;Artillerie in Paris, two of which are regarded as English.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span>&mdash;<i>A bassinet transformed into a sallad in the fifteenth century.

<p>The bassinet, like the rest of the knight&rsquo;s armour, did not necessarily
exhibit a surface of plain burnished steel. It was frequently covered
with leather, as mentioned in the inventories of Humphrey de Bohun,
1322, and of Dover Castle, 1344; while the King of France at one time
wore his bassinet covered with white leather. One of cuir-bouilli, in
Simon Burley&rsquo;s inventory, 1388, is coloured white and green. It was
also tinned or gilded, and even of pure gold, as prizes for tourneys, or like
one set with gems, sent to Edward I. by his father-in-law in 1334. In
a bequest of William Langford, 1411, is a headpiece covered with red
velvet, and actual specimens so covered are not unknown. The richness
of the decorations bestowed on these helmets is shown in the goldsmith&rsquo;s
account of one made for the King of France in 1352, and of another
made in the same year for the Dauphin with a band of forty large pearls.
Effigies and brasses show that coronets and jewelled fillets commonly
adorned them, even in the case of simple knights, and that these are not
imaginary decorations may be gathered from Froissart, who mentions
that the King of Castille actually entered a battle in 1385 with his
bassinet enriched with 20,000 francs&rsquo; worth of gems. Sir Guy of
Warwick, in the Romance, is given a helmet adorned with a circle of
gold set with most precious stones.</p>

<p>Some notable champions, like Sir John Chandos and the Earl of
Warwick, prided themselves on a disregard of danger and habitually
fought without a visor, yet the tendency to close every crevice with plate
defences developed continuously, and the frequent accidents at tourneys,
when the lance-point glanced upward and entered the throat under the
camail, led to the introduction, about 1330, of a gorget of plate or
scales, which with the visor converted the bassinet into a closed helmet.</p>

<p>The defence of the breast was always considered next in importance
to the head, and fourteenth-century inventories constantly refer to &ldquo;pairs
of plates large,&rdquo; perhaps like those till recently worn in Persia, corsets de
fer, cors d&rsquo;acier, brust plate pour justes, and other defences of plate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_35" id="a_Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Chaucer writes, &ldquo;Some would be armed in an haubergeon, a bright
breastplate and a gypoun.&rdquo; The globose form given to the chests of
effigies, such as that of the Black Prince, seems to imply the presence
of a rigid defence under the emblazoned surcoat.</p>

<p>The limbs began to be definitely protected over the mail in the
second half of the thirteenth century. Effigies and manuscript
illustrations of that date commonly represent globose knee-caps, sometimes
ridged down the front, and usually gilt. In the fourteenth
century they are always present and frequently treated very decoratively,
with shields, roundels, scalloped edges, etc. The technical name for
these appendages is &ldquo;Genouillière,&rdquo; or &ldquo;knee-cap.&rdquo; Subsidiary plates
often appear below the knee, and sometimes above it, and are continued
under the mail.</p>

<p>The greave was a rigid gaiter fitting at first only over the front of
the leg below the knee, but afterwards enveloping it; and it was either
of metal or cuir-bouilli. When seen on English fourteenth-century
monuments it usually seems to be of steel fitting closely over the mail,
and laced or buckled at the back, but at times it is so richly decorated as
to suggest cuir-bouilli. Greaves are usually omitted on early monuments,
and are only commonly seen when they had become an integral part of
the suit of armour. As yet they were not habitually worn except in
battle, and knights were not at this time represented in their effigies
accoutred for war, but in ordinary military costume. Thus the effigy<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_36" id="a_Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of Aymer de Valence shows no plate armour, except the genouillière;
but the two mounted figures of the canopy present the visored bassinet,
the high gorget, the arm and elbow plates, the tubular greaves and
steel sollerets for the feet. The tubular leg defence is not seen in earlier
representations, and its introduction may coincide with the first recorded
appearance in the field of large bodies of Welsh armed with long knives.
It was usually hinged and buckled, and becomes more general as the
century advances. This appears in the inventory of Piers Gaveston, 1313,
who possessed three pairs of such greaves. Monstrelet relates that the
bailiff of Evreux, sallying out without his greaves, had his leg badly
broken by the kick of a horse.</p>

<p>Defences of plate armour for the feet are called sollerets, and are
first, if somewhat indistinctly, visible in the small equestrian figure on
the canopy of the tomb of Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster, in
Westminster Abbey, the mail not being continued over the front of the
feet as in the older effigies. One of the small equestrian figures of the
adjoining tomb of Aymer de Valence has the feet, though mutilated,
distinctly covered with small rectangular plates, arranged longitudinally
in continuation of the greaves. In the D&rsquo;Abernon and other brasses
of the second quarter of the fourteenth century laminar plates are
fastened across the upper part of the foot. Other varieties are the
scaled sollerets of the De Cheney brass, 1375; the De Sulney brass, with
sollerets of laminar plates, and one large plate over the instep; the
Littlebury effigy, with longitudinal plates like those of De Valence. In
the effigy of John of Eltham, 1334, we seem for the first time to meet
with the whole foot visible incased in plate, as it continued to be during
the rest of the century. In the Warwick collection a pair of sollerets
are made each of one piece like sabots. The long curved sollerets with
pointed toes of the second half of the fourteenth century are called
pouleynes or poulaines, from the souliers à la Polaine, and differ slightly
from those known as Cracowes, introduced by Richard II. from Bohemia.
There are two fine pointed sollerets at Warwick, one measuring twenty-five
inches from toe to heel, or with the spur thirty-two and a half
inches. Another beautifully-made one attached to leg armour has the
plates scalloped along the edges, and is attributed to Edward, son of
Henry VI.</p>

<p>The gilt spur was the honorific and distinguishing badge of the
knight, and was put on in the ceremony of investiture, and hacked off
by the king&rsquo;s cook if the knight was formally degraded. An immense
spoil of gilt spurs fell to the victors after the battle of Courtrai. Both
the goad and rowel forms were in use throughout the century, and when
knights habitually dismounted to fight, they were taken off. Froissart
mentions instances where they were fixed in the ground like caltrops.
The extravagantly long, rowelled spurs of Henry VI.&rsquo;s time must have
been peculiarly inconvenient.</p>

<p>No great time could well have elapsed before similar defences of plate
were found necessary to protect the shoulders and elbows, which were
scarcely less vulnerable than the legs. The shoulder-pieces, however, are
rarely visible in illustrations and effigies, being much concealed by the
surcoat. The earliest arm-defence is in the form of an elbow-guard, and
appears in the effigy at Salisbury, date about 1260, consisting of one
cupped rosette over another. Elbow-guards are more commonly seen in
the second quarter of the fourteenth century, when they consist of cups
and discs, or both combined, the latter occasionally spiked. The equestrian
figures of the De Valence monument, already mentioned, show in
one case gilt rosettes on the shoulders and elbows, and in the other the
forearms sheathed in plate. John of Eltham, 1334, has a roundel on the
elbow, with articulated plates beneath. In the Ifield effigy the arms are
shown by Stothard completely sheathed, and with shoulder and elbow
roundels bearing embossed lions&rsquo; heads. Plain roundels, rosettes, shells,
or lion masks were worn on the shoulders, and articulated plates are seen
between 1320 and 1350. The singular and exaggerated plates known
as ailettes, picturesque objects which rose above the shoulders like
epaulettes, were as useless apparently as the shoulder-knots of the
present day. They first appear on the scene in the Windsor tournament,
1278, and disappear in the first quarter of the fourteenth century. They
are of many shapes and sizes, and are well seen in our illustration (<a href="#a_fig10">Fig. 10</a>)
from Queen Mary&rsquo;s Psalter, in an elegant brass in Weaver&rsquo;s <i>Funeral
Monuments</i>, as well as in many others, and in several stained-glass windows.
Usually they bear the armorial bearings of the owner, though those of
Piers Gaveston, 1311, were &ldquo;frettez de perles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mail gloves continued to be worn, though with divided fingers, during<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_40" id="a_Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the first part of the fourteenth century. The first effigy to show any
change is that of a Whatton, engraved by Stothard, of the time of
Edward II. Gloves of leather were sometimes worn between 1311 and
1360, as well as others of whalebone, metal studs and splintwork, iron scales
and brass. Plate-armour gauntlets first appear towards the middle of the
century with articulated fingers and a broad plate for the back of the
hand and wrist; whilst a steel cuff, sometimes articulated, was shortly
afterwards added. They are at times spiked, or with gads like knuckle-dusters,
as in the case of the Black Prince, and frequently richly jewelled.
The jewelled example given from the effigy of Sir Thomas Cawne, of
the time of Edward III., is reproduced from Stothard&rsquo;s drawing. The
other is from the monument of the Earl of Westmoreland, of the first
years of Henry VI. Gauntlets are constantly represented as gilt in

<p><span class="smcap">Plate III.</span>&mdash;First suit of Sir Christopher Hatton, Captain of the Guard, and subsequently
Lord Chancellor. Reduced fac-simile of No. 15 in the Armourer&rsquo;s Album
in the South Kensington Museum.</p></div>

<p>The knight&rsquo;s dress for war now consisted, in addition to any ordinary
civilian underclothing, of a more or less complete suit of gambeson or
quilted material, sometimes called the haketon, as in Chaucer&rsquo;s <i>Sir
Thopas</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Next his shert an haketon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over that an habergeon,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ful strong it was of plate;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And over that his cote-armoure.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The habergeon is the mail in this case, and the hauberk is of plate
or splint armour, while the cote-armoure is the surcoat, possibly thickly
padded, as in the still-existing surcoat of the Black Prince. In the
mutilated effigy at Sandwich the thick quilted gambeson is distinctly seen
at the knee and wrist underlying the mail, while the fine hauberk of plate
overlies it, and the surcoat is worn over all. The effigy at Ash shows the
plate armour, under the surcoat, fashioned in the curious armadillo-like
Jazerant or brigandine form, with an upper gambeson under it, as well
as the usual second gambeson under the mail. That two separate quilted
defences were worn at this time is supported by the De Crell brass, 1325,
the D&rsquo;Abernon brass, 1327, and the Ifield and John of Eltham brasses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_41" id="a_Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
1334. The colours of these various garments, the edges of which were
allowed to show one above the other, were no doubt effectively contrasted,
while the edges of the mail, as we have seen, were pinked, vandyked,
or scalloped and gilt or finished with brass rings, while the plate-armour
finishes most commonly in a fringe-like arrangement of small vertical
plates.</p>

<p>The splendid glitter of polished steel, so associated in our minds
with the knight in armour, appealed scarcely at all to its wearers in this
Transition age. In fact, no decided preference can be discovered even
for the defensive qualities of steel, and this constitutes perhaps the most
marked peculiarity of the age. In the halcyon days of mail, the steel
was kept bright and bare, the helm and shield burnished, with
nothing to conceal its brilliancy but a coronet and the rich sword-belts
which merely enhanced the effect. But in Chaucer&rsquo;s <i>Sir Thopas</i> there
is no mention of steel forming part of the visible equipment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His jambeux were of cuirbouly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His swerdes sheth of ivory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His helme of latoun bright.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Over the body armour was a garment, called by Chaucer &ldquo;the cote-armoure,
as white as is the lily floure.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_42" id="a_Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And thereon was a bores hed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A charbouncle beside.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The helmets were almost hidden by the large crests and the scarlet
mantling, and the metal exposed was generally gilt. The trunk armour
was concealed under the emblazoned surcoat or pourpoint; and when
the thighs and legs are visible below this they are seen to be clothed
over the mail by splinted or brigandine armour, showing velvet or satin
externally attached by gilt or silver nails; the knee-caps and greaves
are often richly moulded and probably cuir-bouilli, as seen in the
statues on the front of Exeter Cathedral, and in the paintings from
St. Stephen&rsquo;s Chapel they are also shown as gilt. The arms and at times
the hands are similarly clothed. The horse-armour was almost entirely
concealed by rich caparisons, as in Chaucer&rsquo;s <i>Knightes Tale</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Upon a stede bay, trapped in stele,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Covered with cloth of gold diapered wele.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The figures from the tomb of Edmund Crouchback and Aymer de
Valence, engraved by Stothard, show the emblazoned housings of the
time of Edward II. The equestrian figures in Queen Mary&rsquo;s Psalter show
that the fully-equipped knight of this period, when in full war panoply,
was a gorgeous object, blazing in colours and gold, and exhibiting little
to recall the stern realities of campaigns and sieges.</p>

<p>A few examples from inventories will best illustrate the colours and
the magnificence of the materials used to conceal the steel. Humfrey
de Bohun had breastplates covered with &ldquo;vert velvet&rdquo;; the Earl of
March used &ldquo;rouge samyt&rdquo; and &ldquo;drap d&rsquo;or,&rdquo; and others had &ldquo;cendal
vermeil, samit vermeil, zatony, veluyau asuré, veluyau vert ouvré de
broderie,&rdquo; etc. Piers Gaveston&rsquo;s pair of breastplates were &ldquo;enclouez et
garnie d&rsquo;argent od 4 cheynes d&rsquo;argent covery d&rsquo;un drap de velvet vermail
besaunté d&rsquo;or.&rdquo; Two pairs of plates for the King of France required
3000 crescentic and 3000 round gilt nails to fix the velvet. Exposed
pieces of armour were gilt, if not jewelled, pearls and carbuncles being
the favourite gems. The baldric, knightly belt, sword-belt, hilt, and
scabbard furnished a field for the goldsmith. The magnificence indulged
in was often destructive to the wearers, who might have otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_43" id="a_Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
escaped in battle. They were &ldquo;hunted for their hides,&rdquo; or slain for the
sake of their spoils.</p>

<p>The weight and fashion of the armour largely determined the tactics
in war. The English appear at this time to have reverted to their
ancient practice, once more dismounting to engage in battle. At Cressy
the horses were sent to the rear, while the army, forming into
battalions of archers supported by dismounted men-at-arms, took up its
ground and waited the attack. The weight of armour carried by the
men-at-arms made any forward movement on their part impossible on
foot. By good fortune the 15,000 Genoese cross-bowmen, who might
have inflicted severe loss on the English, were unable to use their bows,
and the French coming up quite out of hand, charged and retreated as
the spirit moved them, without deploying into any battle formation, and
so fell into the utmost confusion, with the well-known results. Our
archers &ldquo;shot their arrows with such force and quickness that it seemed
as if it snowed,&rdquo; piercing the Genoese and dismounting the horsemen;
upon which a body of 1000 Welsh foot with long knives advanced
through the men-at-arms, who made way for them, and slew numbers
of the French chivalry, so that the battle was &ldquo;murderous and cruel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Poitiers, 1356, the English similarly selected a strong position
and awaited the attack dismounted. The French, uncertain how to
meet the enemy, commenced by attacking with a mounted division, which
was routed by the effect of the English arrows on the horses before getting
to close quarters. Their retreat threw the second battalion, which also
appears to have been mounted, into a confusion, which quickly developed
into a panic. Deeming an advance necessary at this critical moment, the
English men-at-arms sent to the rear for their horses and charged, completing
the destruction and dispersal of all but the rear battalion. This
was dismounted in order to fight on foot, and armed with sword
and battle-axe presented a most stubborn front, under the king in
person, numerous parties from the broken battalions rallying and dismounting
to join in its advance. The English resumed the defensive
and remained immovable, the archers plying their arrows with the usual
effect. The only English force capable of movement and able to
skirmish in the field was the archery, while the men-at-arms kept their
ground or advanced very slowly in compact order, until, seeing the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_44" id="a_Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
won, they again mounted to complete the discomfiture and engage in
pursuit.</p>

<p>At the battle of Auray, 1364, the French dismounted and fought
on foot, when the arrows did little execution among them, and the fight
developed into a hand-to-hand engagement with battle-axes, in which
the leaders, Sir Oliver de Clisson and Sir John Chandos, greatly distinguished
themselves. In all subsequent battles and skirmishes between
French and English, until the close of the century, we find that both
sides invariably fought on foot, riding up till almost within striking
distance, and then dismounting as if by common consent. To advance
any distance on foot after dismounting in order to engage was, in fact,
almost impossible. The old knightly weapon, the lance, was in consequence
almost discarded, and could now only be used effectively if
shortened to about five feet, and thus with the shield fell into disuse
as a weapon of battle, while the presence of artillery also began to make
itself felt.</p>

<h2><a name="a_IV" id="a_IV">IV</a><br />
<i>The Age of Plate-Armour</i></h2>


<p>Any line dividing what has here been termed a Transition Age from
the age of fully-developed plate-armour must of necessity be a purely
arbitrary one. Roughly speaking, the age of plate commenced when
mail no longer formed the outer defence of any part of the body. The
last chink, leaving the mail exposed under the armpit, was a vulnerable
opening in the armour called the &ldquo;vif de l&rsquo;harnois,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;defaut de la
cuirasse&rdquo;; and even this now became protected by small plates of steel
called gussets. The necessity for such defences was often proved in
tournaments: it is related that the lance pierced &ldquo;au vif de l&rsquo;harnois&rdquo;
for lack of the crescent or &ldquo;gouchet.&rdquo; When these last plates were added
the knights appeared more invulnerable than Achilles. We find at
almost every period, however, that a fair blow delivered &ldquo;au pas de charge&rdquo;
with a well-steeled lance might penetrate every defence; and that no
armour could be made actually proof against downright blows from a
two-handed battle-axe wielded by a powerful and expert rider.</p>

<p>One of the most marked characteristics of this age of plate-armour
was a growing appreciation of the intrinsic beauty of steel, and a new
desire to invest steel armour with graceful lines. The tendency is best
exemplified in the fine Gothic armour of the second half of the fifteenth
century, of which much is fortunately preserved. This combines most
splendidly picturesque outlines with graceful fan or shell-like ridgings,
which please the more when examined critically, since every curve and
fluting serves some definite and practical end.</p>

<p>The casing of plate-armour, which had been so long elaborating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_46" id="a_Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
having at last become complete, the work of the armourer was directed
to further perfecting its parts, and to disencumbering the wearer, with
the least risk, of his weighty underlying chain-mail, quilted gambesons,
and padded surcoats. This process had not proceeded far when Agincourt
was fought, if we may credit the testimony of a French knight, who was
present and describes the armour as consisting of the long hauberk of
chain-mail reaching below the knee, and very heavy, with the leg-armour
beneath, and over this the plate or white armour with the bassinet and
camail. One Allbright, noted particularly as &ldquo;mail-maker,&rdquo; and twelve
other armourers, were in the suite of the king on this expedition. The
weight of armour would, therefore, have rendered a repetition advisable,
on the part of the English, of the tactics of Cressy or Poitiers in this
battle, had not the French disconcerted us by dismounting and seating
themselves, and refusing to advance. They had also, copying the
English, brought a large force of archers and cross-bowmen into the
field, and, in addition, kept bodies of men-at-arms in the saddle on
either wing, to make flank attacks when opportunities occurred. The
English having in vain endeavoured to provoke the enemy to advance
by sending out archers to fire a house and barn, posted an ambuscade
and moved forward, the archers in front as usual and the men-at-arms
behind. The archers thus gave up the shelter of their pointed stakes,
and the men-at-arms suffered the fatigue of an advance in armour
of an almost insupportable weight to men on foot. They advanced,
however, with repeated huzzas, but, as the Chroniclers inform us,
&ldquo;often stopping to take breath.&rdquo; The French, stooping their visors
under the amazing hail of arrows that began to fall upon them, gave way
a few paces, and the English, coming close up, pressed them soon afterwards
so hardly, &ldquo;that only the front ranks with shortened lances could
raise their hands.&rdquo; Our archers, flinging away their bows, fought lustily
with swords, hatchets, mallets, or bill-hooks, supported manfully by King
Henry and his men-at-arms. Pressing on and slaying all before them,
they routed the van and reached the main body, which was also quickly
destroyed. The rear battalion of the French, which had remained
mounted, then fled panic-struck, and the battle terminated in some
desultory charges made by a few parties of nobles and their men-at-arms,
which were easily repulsed; 10,000 French perished, all but 1600 being<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_47" id="a_Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
gentlemen! many in the massacre of prisoners consequent on a false
alarm. The battle of Verneuil, so fatal nine years later to the Scots,
who lost the Earls of Douglas, Murray, and Buchan, with the flower of
their army, was fought on precisely the same lines; the main French
battalion with their Scottish allies on foot being first shaken by the
storm of arrows, and then destroyed at close quarters by the advance of
the archers with the usual &ldquo;loud shouts,&rdquo; supported by the Duke of
Bedford and the men-at-arms. These defeats caused the French to
again waver in their plan for meeting the enemy, for at the battle
of Herrings, and the skirmish at Beauvais in 1430, they made their attack
mounted, the English archers receiving the first charge behind their
palisade of pointed stakes, and defeating the enemy by the clouds of
arrows taking their usual deadly effect on the horses. These stakes, six feet
long and sharpened at both ends, formed an important item of the archers&rsquo;
equipment, and were planted in the ground by the front rank, sloping
towards the enemy, the next rank fixing theirs intermediately to affright
the enemy&rsquo;s horse. Throughout the Anglo-Burgundian alliance, the
Burgundians of all arms were often compelled &ldquo;under pain of death&rdquo;
to fight dismounted, the Picards especially adopting the tactics and
perhaps equalling the English. A little later, as at the battle of
Montlhéry, 1465, both Burgundian and English archers are armed
with the formidable long-handled leaden mauls or mallets, which the
armour of the men-at-arms was incapable of resisting. In the account
of one of these battles we learn incidentally that the duty of the varlets
who invariably formed part of the retinue of each man-at-arms was
to succour and refresh their masters during the heat of the engagement,
and to carry the prisoners they took to the rear.</p>

<p>As the various hauberks of mail, brigandines, gambesons, and other
defences became more or less obsolete and discarded by men-at-arms
armed cap-à-pied, they were relegated to a lighter-armed cavalry and the
infantry; but so long as a suit of mail continued to be worn by the man-at-arms
as a defence underlying the armour of plate, flexibility in the
latter was of paramount importance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span>&mdash;<i>Helm from the tomb of Henry V.
in Westminster Abbey, date 1400-1420.
From a photograph lent by
Baron de Cosson.</i></p></div>

<p>Regarding the armour of Henry V. as the earliest complete cap-à-pied
plate-armour, we find it thus composed. The breast and back plates are
each of one piece, the gorget is usually in one, though a standard of mail<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_48" id="a_Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
sometimes replaces it; the limb-defences are of few pieces and rigid,
except at the joints, which are guarded by caps or roundels; while the
armour of the fingers, toes, and upper surfaces of the shoulders is
articulated or protected by narrow laminar plates. The introduction of
the gussets, and more particularly of the horizontal bands of plate forming
a short petticoat below the waist, materially altered the appearance of
the armour of the fifteenth century from that of the fourteenth. The
plates of the petticoat, called the tassets, are first seen in the brass of
Nicholas Hawberk, at Cobham, who died in 1406, and they gradually
increase in number till about 1420. At Agincourt, where the
fighting was on foot, the visored bassinet
would have been worn by the king
and his men-at-arms, and not the great
helm. The example of the latter suspended
in the chantry of Henry V.
in Westminster Abbey, though a real
helm, was only purchased from Thomas
Daunt, for 33s. 4d., according to
Rymer, with the crest, for the funeral.
The bassinet was probably plumed
with ostrich feathers, which were taking
the place of crests, and was encircled
by a coronet, damaged in the melée
by a blow from the Duke of Alençon,
which among its jewels comprised the ruby of the Black Prince, now in
the regalia. The diamond-hilted sword was not taken into the fray, unfortunately,
as it happened, and fell a prey to the baggage-looters. The
king is generally represented wearing a tabard of arms on this occasion, a
garment differing from the surcoat in being loose and cut like the modern
herald&rsquo;s tabard, emblazoned before and behind and on the broad flaps which
do duty for sleeves. The horses, borrowing the custom of Lombardy,
wore a heavy chamfron or headpiece of plate, of which a specimen still
exists in Warwick Castle, and an articulated crinet or neck-defence of overlapping
plates, put together on the same plan as the tassets, and probably
some mail defences concealed by the emblazoned caparisons. The ostentatious
magnificence which had hitherto covered the body armour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_49" id="a_Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
knight with silks and satins, velvet and bullion and gems, especially among
the Burgundian French, was now in process of being transferred to the
horse. The housings are described as of silks and satins of every colour,
or velvet crimson and blue, or cloth of gold, and sweeping the ground,
besprinkled with escutcheons of arms, and loaded with silversmith&rsquo;s work,
or raised work of solid gold. We read of trappings of white silver
fringed with cloth of gold, and of cloth of gold interwrought with solid
silver; and it appears that no materials were too rich to deck out the
favourite destrier or war-horse. It is unlikely that the English were at
this time behind the French in display, for so early as 1409, of the six
pages of Sir John de Cornewall, two rode horses covered with ermine,
and four horses with cloth of gold; and in 1414 the English embassy
carried themselves so magnificently that the French, and especially the
Parisians, were astonished. Splendid, however, as were the housings, the
headpieces of the horses eclipsed them. The horse of the Count de Foix
at the entry into Bayonne had a headpiece of steel enriched with gold
work and precious stones to the value of 15,000 crowns. The Count
de St. Pol&rsquo;s horse&rsquo;s headpiece on leaving Rouen was estimated to be
worth 30,000 francs, while those of the Dukes of Burgundy and Cleves
on the entry of Louis XI. into Paris were still more magnificent. That
of the king, however, was on this occasion merely of fine gold with
ostrich plumes of various colours. As with the armour in the fourteenth
century, the rich trappings of the horse naturally led at times to the
pursuit and capture of the owner. It is difficult to believe, in days of
such magnificence, that the pay of the Duke of York under Henry V.
was only 13s. 4d. per day, an earl received but 6s. 8d., a baron or banneret
4s., a knight 2s., an esquire 1s., and an archer 6d.</p>

<p>Though Henry V. wore royal armour at Agincourt it does not
appear that he followed the prudent custom, first noticed in the battle
of Viterbo, 1243, of dressing several knights in an identical manner with
himself. At Viterbo, on a knight dressed like the emperor being slain, the
result was a panic, and the emperor himself had to press with his trumpets
into the thickest of the fight to restore confidence. At Poitiers, though
nineteen knights were dressed like the king, it did not preserve him
from capture. In England, however, the king was saved on many a
field by this precaution, as at the battle of Shrewsbury, when the earl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_50" id="a_Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Sir Walter Blount and two others in royal armour were slain. The
passages in Shakespeare will be present to the mind of all:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Another king! they grow like hydras&rsquo; heads;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am the Douglas fatal to all those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wear those colours on them. Who art thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That counterfeit&rsquo;st the person of a king?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>and again, when Richard exclaims at Bosworth&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I think there be six Richmonds in the field:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Five have I slain to-day instead of him.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The appreciation of steel, called by the Chroniclers plain or white
armour, for its own sake, had not progressed very far by the time
of Henry V.&rsquo;s invasion of France, but the more lavish splendours were
at least reserved for gala occasions. The next modifications were
evidently devised to increase the flexibility of the armour, and can be
traced with greater precision in England than elsewhere, owing to the
fortunate preservation in our churches of a matchless series of military
monumental brasses. These clearly indicate that the tendency during
the first half of the fifteenth century was to increase the number of
joints or articulations in every part of the armour. By the close of the
reign of Henry V. things had proceeded so far in this direction that
in some cases the greater part of the limb-defences are made up of
laminated plates.</p>

<p>The next important change in the appearance of the man-at-arms
occurs in the early years of Henry VI., and is due to a striking development
of the fan-shaped elbow-guards, first seen in a rudimentary form
in 1425, as well as to an addition of short hinged plates called tuilles
to the bottom of the hoop-like skirt of tassets which lay closer to the
body. By 1435 these tuilles are ridged or fluted perpendicularly and
scalloped along the lower edge, and shortly after they take the more
developed, elongate and elegant forms familiar in Gothic armour. By
1440 we have the addition of great shoulder and elbow plates attached
by nuts and screws, and concealing the articulated shoulder-pieces or
epaulettes. These extra plates usually differ in size, being often very
much larger on the left side, which received the blows, and thus conferring
a quite peculiar character on the plate-armour of the middle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_51" id="a_Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
century. A scarcely less important modification, introduced about 1445,
is the articulation of the breastplate in two pieces, the lower overlapping
and sliding over the upper, and made flexible by straps.</p>

<p>The Daundelyon brass of this date, at Margate, exhibits a left
elbow-piece of immense size, and pointed and ridged tuilles below the
tassets, which are almost repeated again in form by the plates below
the knee-caps. John Gaynesford&rsquo;s brass at Crowhurst, 1450, presents
strong reinforcing shoulder-guards over articulated plates, and repeats
the same long peaked and ridged plates below the knee-cap. We
continue for the next few years to find the limb-defences constantly
varying in the number and form of the pieces composing them, according
to the dictates of conflicting requirements, namely flexibility and impenetrability.
The frequent absence of tuilles at this time is held to
imply that they were not used in combats on foot, then very popular.
It is obvious that when the immensely long and pointed solleret came in
with the equally preposterous spur, the fashion of fighting on foot was
on the wane, and the men-at-arms generally fought mounted during the
Wars of the Roses.</p>

<p>We see by manuscript illustrations that a few suits were still gilded,
and we find Jack Cade after his victory in 1450 flourishing about in a
suit of gilt armour, the spoils of Sir Humphrey Stafford. But the ever-growing
appreciation of the intrinsic beauty of the steel panoply and
its fine military qualities is now distinctly felt, and the armourer sought
more and more to invest his work with beauty of form. All is still
entirely dictated by fitness to its purpose, and the requirements of jousts
and war; and the decorative and subtle shell-like ridgings and flutings
are really present more to deflect the weapon&rsquo;s point than as ornament,
while the engrailing, dentelling, scalloping and punching of the margins
of the plates unmistakably indicate that the decorative spirit is applied
to embellishing and not to concealing the steel. The superb gilded
metal effigy (<a href="#a_fig19">Fig. 19</a>) of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, presents
a faithful model of the most beautiful type of Gothic armour known.
Every fastening, strap, buckle or hinge is represented with scrupulous
fidelity, not only on the front, but on the unseen back. Baron
de Cosson, who has minutely described it, expresses the belief that
it is a faithful reproduction of a suit actually worn by the Earl, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_52" id="a_Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
therefore earlier than 1439; although the effigy itself was only
produced in 1454, and the armour agrees with that worn in England
at the latter date. He regards the suit represented as the work
of the celebrated contemporary Milanese armourers, the Missaglias.
Italian armour is shown by sculptures, medals and paintings to have been
many years in advance of English, and the two known contemporary
suits by Tomaso di Missaglia greatly resemble it. The Earl of
Warwick knew Milan in his youth, when he had tilted successfully at
Verona; and it was a practice among the great to obtain armour there,
dating from so far back as 1398, when the Earl of Derby had his armour
brought over by Milanese armourers; the Baron&rsquo;s view presents therefore
no improbabilities. Wherever made, the Earl of Warwick&rsquo;s suit appears
to have solved the armourer&rsquo;s problem, being at once light, flexible, yet
impenetrable. Indeed, in its beautiful proportions and admirably perfect
adaptation to all requirements, it appears more like a work of nature than
of art. The contours of the pieces and their graceful fan-like flutings, to
give strength and deflect opponents&rsquo; blows, are artistically splendid. The
great shoulder-guards and elbow-pieces, the cuissarts and winged kneecaps,
the tuilles, the jointed breast and back plates, the upright neck-guard,
not hitherto seen, are all fashioned with consummate skill. In such a
suit the preux and gallant knight for three days held his tournament
victoriously against all comers, presenting each of his discomfited
adversaries with new war-chargers, feasting the whole company, and
finally &ldquo;returning to Calais with great worship.&rdquo; The two cuts (Figs. 20
and 21), illustrating scenes from his life, are taken from the exquisitely
drawn illustrations to the contemporary Beauchamp manuscript, now in the
British Museum. The incidental testimonies to the excellence of Italian
armour of the middle of the fifteenth century are abundant. A stalwart
Burgundian champion tried in vain during a tournament in 1446 to
penetrate or find a crevice in the armour of the Duke of Milan&rsquo;s
chamberlain, whom it was impossible to wound; and in 1449 the suit
of another knight in the service of the same Duke was said to be steeped
in some magic liquid, as so light a harness could not possibly have
otherwise withstood the heavy blows it received.</p>

<p>No word ever escapes the chronicler in praise of English armour;
but the splendid model of the Earl of Warwick&rsquo;s suit is by William Austin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_53" id="a_Page_53">[Pg 53]</a><br /><a name="a_Page_54" id="a_Page_54">[Pg 54]</a><br /><a name="a_Page_55" id="a_Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>

the gilding, chasing, and polishing by Bartholomew Lambespring,
Dutchman and goldsmith of London. The will directs that the
effigy shall be made according to patterns, directions obviously most
scrupulously carried out.</p>

<p>The Earl of Warwick slays a &ldquo;mighty Duke&rdquo; who has challenged him to combat for his lady&rsquo;s sake, and wins
the favour of the Empress, to whom he makes a present of pearls and precious stones. The costume is
about fifteen or twenty years later than the death of Earl Richard, and shows the extra pieces worn in
the tilt-yard, 1450-60.</p></div>

<p>In contemplating the lithe figure we may well believe that the
steely quality and workmanship of such a suit would confer immunity
on the wearer; and that the relative elasticity and lightness of a perfectly-fitting
suit might confer such superiority on an active and sinewy champion
engaging with men swathed like mummies beneath their armour in
thick gambeson or mail, as to enable him to emerge from his deeds of
arms as triumphantly as the heroes of romance. Nothing was worn
beneath but the fustian doublet, well padded and lined with satin, with
the small lozenge-shaped gussets of mail under the limb-joints and the
short petticoat of mail tied round the waist. It is also unlikely that such<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_56" id="a_Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
armour was concealed under any garment, and we may observe that
while some princes and nobles are still wearing brigandines of velvet
and cloth of gold in pageants, many more are in &ldquo;plain armour,&rdquo;
presenting, except when standing collars of mail were worn, a uniform
surface of smooth polished steel.</p>

<p>The Missaglia suit remained the type with little modification for
several years, almost to the close of the Gothic period. The Quatremayne
brass in Thame Church, of the year 1460, presents a magnificent
example of it with singularly exaggerated elbow-guards. During the next
few years the limb-pieces and gorget become more articulated and flexible,
and the breast and back plates are formed of as many as three or four
overlapping articulated plates, cut chevron-wise, and notched and
indented in an interesting manner. The gauntlets and sollerets are
also of excellent workmanship. There are a number of peculiarly fine
examples in the Museum of Artillery in the Rotunda at Woolwich, from
the Isle of Rhodes, which exhibit the graceful outlines and ornament
of later fifteenth-century Gothic armour in perfection, and also present
early and interesting examples of engraving on armour. Lord Zouche
has also some remarkable suits, said to be from the Church of Irene at
Constantinople, in his collection at Parham. Sir Noel Paton&rsquo;s fine
collection also comprises several Gothic suits, and there are some in the
Tower. None, however, are connected historically with English wearers,
and the destruction of Gothic armour in this country appears to have
been unusually complete. The illustrations from the <i>Life of the Earl of
Warwick</i>, an English MS. of the second half of the fifteenth century (Figs.
20 and 21); and the scene (<a href="#a_fig25">Fig. 25</a>) from the late fifteenth-century MS.
of Froissart, which belonged to Philip de Commines, both now in the
British Museum, give excellent ideas of the armour of this period in
actual use, while the brasses supply exact figures of the details.</p>

<p>The Duke of Gloucester and Earls of Warwick and Stafford chase the Duke of Burgundy from the walls of
Calais. They wear loose sleeves and skirts of mail, and the round broad-brimmed helmet very fashionable
for a time among the higher French nobility. The balls and tufts are probably Venice gold, with which
the helmet was perhaps also laced, over some rich material. This and <a href="#a_fig20">Fig. 20</a> are from the Beauchamp
MS. in the British Museum, an exquisite production by an English hand.</p></div>

<p>Turning now to head-defences, the great crested helm, still represented
as pillowing the head in effigies, had long since been relegated to
the joust and tilt, while the bassinet with a visor, already seen in
the Transition period, remained the fighting helmet till about the middle
of the century. The visor, however, was not unfrequently struck or
wrenched off in tourneys, and the neck pierced by the lance. Some
hardy warriors, indeed, like Sir John Chandos and the Earl of Warwick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_57" id="a_Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
dispensed with it and went into the fray with faces bare, but this was
exceptional, and the pig-faced and beaked visored bassinets occur in
all delineations of combats of the first half of the century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_58" id="a_Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>The bassinet began to be superseded towards the middle of the
fifteenth century by the sallad, which remained in fashion almost to its
close. Its merits were, the free supply of air it afforded, and the
readiness with which the face could be concealed and protected. It
was the headpiece of the Gothic armour, such as that of the Warwick
effigy, though monuments of this date almost always leave the head
bare. The origin of the sallad, whether German or Italian, is unknown,
but the term occurs in Chaucer. In its simplest form it was low-crowned,
projecting behind, and strapped under the chin, something
like a &ldquo;sou&rsquo;wester&rdquo; or the heraldic chapeau, and in this form it was
worn by archers and billmen. Another kind had a higher crown, with
two slits in front as an ocularium, and could be pulled over the brows
till this came level with the eyes (<a href="#a_fig22">Fig. 22</a>). A hinged nose-piece
was also sometimes present, to be let down in time of danger. It was
also made more completely protective by a chin-piece called the bavier,
strapped round the neck or fastened to the breastplate for tilting; while
a lighter bavier was in two pieces, of which the upper was hinged at
the side and could be raised for speaking. It was frequently furnished
with a visor to let down. The tail-piece was occasionally so prolonged
that sallads measure as much as eighteen inches from back to front. It
occurs both smooth-topped and combed, and with a slot for plumes
approaches nearer to classic models than any other form of mediæval
helmet. This picturesque headpiece is the one so frequently represented
by Albert Dürer, and was favoured for a longer time in Germany than
elsewhere, many of the Germans in the picture of the meeting of
Maximilian and Henry VIII. appearing in it, while all the English wear
the later close helmet or armet. The form represented has the addition
of articulated pieces behind and a double visor moving on pivots at the
sides, which make it a near approach to a closed helmet.</p>

<p>The sallad was the principal helmet in use throughout the Wars of
the Roses, and is constantly represented in manuscripts of that period.
But one solitary example has been preserved in England from the time of
those destructive wars, in which its first wearer may have taken part. It
hangs in St. Mary&rsquo;s Hall, Coventry, and owes its preservation to its
use as a stage property in the Godiva processions. There are specimens,
however, in all the important collections in England and abroad.</p>

<p>The bassinet was sometimes richly decorated, covered with velvet,
plumed, crested, and of considerable value, Sir John de Cornwall wagering
his helmet in 1423, which he offered to prove to be worth 500 nobles. The
pretty custom of garlanding them with may, marguerites, or other flowers
specially favoured by a queen or princess,
or with chaplets of pearls and
other gems, seen in the early part of the
century, lasted until after the introduction
of the sallad, which provided a
better field for such display. A sallad
belonging to the Duke of Burgundy,
decorated with rubies and diamonds to
the estimated value of 100,000 crowns,
figured in the entry of Louis XI. into
Paris in 1443. In the expenses of
Henry VII. precious stones and pearls
are bought from the Lombards to the
value of £3800 for embellishing sallads
and other helmets, and in France even
the sallads of the mounted archers are
continually mentioned as garnished
with silver.</p>

<p>2. Helm of Sir Giles Capel, date 1510-1525.
Formerly in Rayne Church, Essex. Now in
the possession of Baron de Cosson.</p></div>

<p>The sallad was a relatively dangerous
headpiece in tourneys on foot, and
a large-visored bassinet is often mentioned
as being retained in use for this
purpose down to the sixteenth century.
The Baron de Cosson has identified
this form, seen to have been fixed to
the breast by two staples and a double
buckle behind, and himself possesses
a magnificent example, which once hung over the tombs of the Capels in
Rayne Church. Sir Giles Capel was one of the knights who with Henry
VIII. challenged all comers for thirty days on the Field of the Cloth of
Gold. The visor in this example is very massive, the holes so small that no
point could possibly enter, and the helm being fixed the head moved freely<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_60" id="a_Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
inside. A second and possibly earlier example has the visor thrown into
horizontal ridges and a small bavier. The visor is hinged at the sides,
and the sight and breathing holes are short slots, parallel to and protected
by the ridges. It hangs over the tomb of John Beaufort, Duke of
Somerset, in Wimborne Minster, who died in 1444, but it is of later
date; and another belonging to the suit of Henry VIII. in the Tower,
made for fighting on foot, is not dissimilar. Baron de Cosson calls
attention to the fact that this form, called a bassinet, is shown in the
miniature of the manuscript entitled, &ldquo;How a man shalle be armyd at his
ese when he schal fighte on foote.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another very interesting and
thoroughly English form of helm,
intended, according to De Cosson, for
the tilt with lances, is preserved in
a specimen in Broadwater Church,
another in Willington Church over
Sir John Gostwick&rsquo;s tomb, and a third
in Cobham Church, the helm of Sir
Thomas Brooke, who died 1522.
These all present considerable differences
of detail. A not dissimilar
helm of slightly later date with a
barred visor, or the bars riveted to
the helm, affording plenty of breathing
space, was used for the tourney
with sword or battle-axe, and has become the Royal and the nobles&rsquo;
helmet of heraldry.</p>

<p>A form of helm used for tilting with the lance and also frequently depicted
in heraldry, is the great helm of the time of Henry VII. and Henry
VIII., of immense weight and strength, resting on the shoulders, and
securely fixed to the back and breast. It was relatively flat on the crown,
produced in front into a kind of blunt beak, giving a bird-like aspect
with no distinct neck. The ocularium, or slit for vision, is large and in
the crown, and can only be used by bending the body forward; the head
being raised before the moment of impact to avoid the danger of the
lance penetrating. This helm is well represented in the tournament roll<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_61" id="a_Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
of Henry VIII. in Heralds&rsquo; College, and from its massive strength and
the fact that by no possibility could a combatant be accidentally unhelmed,
afforded absolute protection to the head. Le Heaulme du Roy is
represented in this roll as silvered, with a crown-like border round the neck
of pearls and gems set in gold.
There is a magnificent specimen
in the Museum of Artillery at
Woolwich, one in Westminster
Abbey, two in St. George&rsquo;s Chapel,
one in Petworth Church, and one
at Parham. This form of helm
was the most massive and secure,
and the last that remained in use.
A very early delineation of a
helmet of this type is seen in the
late fourteenth-century French
MS. (Burney, 257) in the British
Museum. Some exceedingly interesting
delineations of the same
kind of tilting helm in actual
use are to be seen in Philip de
Commines&rsquo; Froissart, Harl. MS.,
4379-80 (<a href="#a_fig25">Fig. 25</a>). It is there
represented plain and fluted, and
with various crests and mantling,
one of the most singular, and a
favourite, being a close copy of
the lady&rsquo;s head-dress of the period,
with the lady&rsquo;s long gauze veil
reaching below the waist. This
manuscript is of late fifteenth-century date, and very remarkable for the
apparently faithful representations of the armour worn by the English and
French at that time. In one group of soldiery alone, in the second
volume, page 84, the helm of the early fourteenth century, the beaked
bassinet of the early fifteenth, and various forms of visored and unvisored
sallads are assembled together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_62" id="a_Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p><div class="center">

<p>All these forms of helm were more or less contemporary with the
sallad, which gave place in turn to the armet or closed helmet, first
heard of in 1443. Like, perhaps, the sallad, the armet was invented
in Italy, and did not reach England or even Germany till about 1500.
In France, however, a page of the Count de St. Pol bore a richly-worked
armet on the entry into Rouen of Charles VII.; and the royal armet of
Louis XI., crowned and richly adorned with fleurs-de-lis, was carried
before him on his entry into Paris in 1461. It is also mentioned in
1472, in an edict of the Duke of Burgundy.</p>

<p>The fundamental difference between it and all helms and helmets
that had preceded it is, that while others had either fitted the top of the
head, as a cap does, or were put right over it, the armet closed round
the head by means of hinges, following the contour of the chin and
neck. Its advantages were neatness, lightness, and general handiness,
and it conveyed the weight by the gorget directly on to the shoulders.
Its use was exclusively for mounted combatants, though the great helm
continued in use for jousts and tilts during the time of Henry VIII.
It does not appear in English costume much before this reign, but in
all the pictures of the triumphs and battle-pieces of Henry VIII. at
Hampton Court, the English men-at-arms invariably wear it, and it is
abundantly represented in works of art during the remainder of the
Tudor period.</p>

embroidered with gold. From the Philip de Commines copy of Froissart, Harl. MS. 4379, vol. 1, fol. 99, in the British Museum, late fifteenth century.</p></div>

<p>An early armet, identified by Baron de Cosson as Italian, with
a double bavier riveted together, but without a visor, hangs over the
tomb of Sir George Brooke, eighth Lord Cobham, K.G. (<a href="#a_fig26">Fig. 26</a>),
and dates from 1480 to 1500. Baron de Cosson describes it as having
a reinforcing piece on the forehead, hinged cheek-pieces joined down the
middle of the chin, and of peculiarly delicate and beautiful outline. It
originally had a camail hanging to a leather strap. The wooden Saracen&rsquo;s
head may date from the funeral of this Lord Cobham in 1558, &ldquo;but
was certainly never worn on any helmet.&rdquo; Its owner served under
Norfolk in Ireland, in 1520, and was subsequently Governor of Calais.</p>

<p>English armets dating from about 1500 are not uncommon, but, as
frequently observed, &ldquo;they want that perfection and delicacy to be found
in fine Italian or German work.&rdquo; The earlier open down the front, and
the later at the side. They are generally combed, the ridge or comb<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_63" id="a_Page_63">[Pg 63]</a><br /><a name="a_Page_64" id="a_Page_64">[Pg 64]</a><br /><a name="a_Page_65" id="a_Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
running from the forehead to the back of the neck, and being beaten
or raised out of the metal in the most
able way. There is generally, but not
always, a reinforcing piece over the
forehead. The visor is of one piece,
and works on a pivot, but in a few of
the early specimens the pin and hinge
arrangement of the older Italian
examples is preserved, rendering it
removable. The slit for vision is
generally made in the body of the
visor, but is sometimes obtained by
cutting out a piece of its upper edge.
It is beaked, thrown into few or
several ridges, with the slits or holes
for breathing principally on the right
side. The English armet was rarely
furnished with a bavier or movable
chin-piece, and the fixed one, called a
mentonière, was small. Baron de
Cosson obtained one from Rayne
Church in Essex, when it was pulled down, and Meyrick procured a
similar one from Fulham Church, and
Mr. Seymour Lucas, A.R.A., has two
very fine specimens, now exhibited at
South Kensington, while specimens are
to be met with in most great collections.
The not inelegant fluted
Maximilian armets of the same date
are, however, far more frequent.
Like the later English armets, they
have no baviers. Between 1510 and
1525, a hollow rim was introduced
round the base of the helmet, fitting
closely into a corresponding ridge round the upper edge of the gorget.
This manifest improvement was considered by Meyrick to constitute the<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_66" id="a_Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Burgonet. Between 1520 and 1540 the visor was formed of two parts,
the upper of which closed inside the lower, and was capable of being raised
without unfixing the latter. It remained in this form until the closed
helmet fell into disuse in the seventeenth century. The armet frequently
comprised, especially in the later examples, a fixed gorget, generally of two
or more articulated plates. A number of these are included in the sixteenth
and seventeenth century suits illustrated in the succeeding pages,
one of the most singular being the helmet of the mounted suit of Henry
VIII., made for the king by Conrad Seusenhofer of Innsbrück in 1511-14.
It consists of six pieces fitting one within another without hinge or rivet,
and seems originally to have had one of the curious discs at the back
seen in Italian fifteenth-century armets and contemporary illustrations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span>&mdash;<i>Complete suit for fighting on foot, made for Henry VIII.
In the Tower of London.</i></p></div>

<p>Towards the beginning of the sixteenth century knightly armour
underwent some profound modifications. The exaggerated elbow-guards
and shoulder-pieces were reduced, the tuilles, the laminated corselets
with their handsome flutings and indented margins, and the pointed
sollerets were either modified or seen no more; and with them disappear
much of the angulated, defensive mannerism, and the grace peculiar to
the armour of the third quarter of the fifteenth century. That which
followed appears smoother, rounder, and heavier, less mobile, and
less apt for real campaigning. The modifications tending to this result
may have been in a large degree due to the personal tastes of the three
great monarchs of Europe. Maximilian and Henry VIII. preferred
at heart the pomp and pageantry to the realities of war; while the
classic bias of Francis I. banished all Gothic feeling so far as his
personal influence extended. The short-waisted, podgy, globular
breastplate, the stolid limb-pieces, rounded knee-caps and strikingly
splay-footed sollerets, appear as if invented to altogether banish
the very idea of agility, if not of movement; and contrast in the
strongest manner with the lithe and supple-looking armour of the
Beauchamp effigy. The Tower collection, so relatively poor in Gothic
armour, is fortunately extremely rich in that of the period of Henry
VIII., containing four or five suits actually made for his personal
use. One of the finest of these, and an admirably perfect suit, is
shown in our illustration (<a href="#a_fig28">Fig. 28</a>). Though without any decoration
or marks, it was undoubtedly made expressly for the king,<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_67" id="a_Page_67">[Pg 67]</a><br /><a name="a_Page_68" id="a_Page_68">[Pg 68]</a><br /><a name="a_Page_69" id="a_Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
and is a chef-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre of the armourer&rsquo;s craft, being formed, according
to Lord Dillon, of no less than 235 separate pieces, which
are used about one half below and the rest above the waist.
The principal pieces are fitted with a hollow groove along the inferior
margin, and overlap others provided with a corresponding ridge: so
that the whole suit thus interlocks, and the plates cannot be separated
or the armour taken apart except by removing the helmet and beginning
at the neck-pieces. To the left shoulder-piece or pauldron one
of the upright neck-guards is still fixed by rivets. The breastplate
is globose, and has a central ridge called the tapul. The arms are
sheathed in rigid plates, separated by a series of narrow laminar plates, by
which power of movement is obtained. The elbows are guarded by not
inelegant caps, and the gauntlets are miton-fashioned, of eleven small
plates, and very flexible. The leg-armour is in large pieces ridged
down the centre, similarly to the breastplate, except above and below
the knee-cap, and at the ankle, where laminar plates give the necessary
play. The sollerets being made, like the gauntlets, each of
thirteen pieces, are also extremely flexible, and reproduce in an exaggerated
way the great broad toes of the civil dress. Like the helm,
already noticed, the suit is intended for combats on foot and in the
lists, which were greatly in fashion. No mail gussets were needed,
for there were no crevices between the plates, and the wearer inside
his armour was as well defended as a lobster in its shell; but this
security, as with all armour-plate, was purchased, notwithstanding the
perfection of manufacture, at the expense of unwieldiness and fatigue,
for the suit weighs over 92 lbs. There are three other suits which
belonged to Henry VIII., besides the magnificent equestrian one next
figured. The second dismounted one was also intended for combats
on foot, and is known as a tonlet suit from the long, laminated skirt
of horizontal plates reaching to the knee, and sliding over each
other. It is decorated with some engraved bands or borders, while
the fine headpiece to it is Italian, bearing the marks of the celebrated
Missaglias of Milan. We meet at this time with the sliding rivets, a
new mode of attachment for the plates, which enabled them to play
freely over each other without parting company. The overlapping
tassets of most of the close-fitting skirts are made in this fashion, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_70" id="a_Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
which the term Almayne rivets, so frequently met with in inventories, is
believed to apply. Some of the suits are provided with a locking
gauntlet, to prevent the sword from being struck out of the wearer&rsquo;s
hand, the so-called forbidden gauntlet, though its prevalence in collections
negatives the idea that its use was disallowed. In one mounted suit
the insteps are protected by the great ungainly stirrups necessitated by
the broad-toed sollerets, and therefore only covered with mail. This
suit is enriched with a picturesque banded ornament, partly gilt.</p>

finest of its date in existence, was constructed to the order of Maximilian
expressly for Henry VIII., by Conrad Seusenhofer, one of the most
celebrated armourers of Innsbrück, whose mark it bears on the helmet.
It was sent as a gift in 1514, and was originally silvered all over, and
finely engraved in every part with the legend of St. George and
the badges of Henry VIII. and Katharine of Arragon. The Tudor
cognisances are the rose, portcullis and red dragon; and Katharine&rsquo;s
the pomegranate and sheaf of arrows, with finely-scrolled arabesque work
between. This ornament seems to be engraved and not etched, as in later
times. The most remarkable feature is the steel skirt called base, of
great rarity, and made in imitation of the folds of the cloth bases so
much in vogue at this time. These skirts were used for fighting on
foot, and there is provision for fixing an additional piece to complete
it in front, the absence of which alone permitted the wearer to sit on
horseback, though the difficulty of getting into the saddle must have been
considerable. The skirt is edged with a finely-modelled border of brass
in high relief, with the initials H. and K. united by true-lover&rsquo;s knots.
The suit is complete in every respect except the gauntlets, and is
mentioned in the Greenwich inventory of 1547, published in the fifty-first
volume of <i>Archæologia</i> by Lord Dillon. It is there described as &ldquo;a
harnesse given unto the King&rsquo;s Maiestie by Th<sup>e</sup> Empero<sup>r</sup> Maximilian
w<sup>t</sup> a Base of stele and goldesmythes worke.&rdquo; The brass border to the
base thus appears to have been regarded as silver and gilt goldsmiths&rsquo;
work. The horse armour matching the suit, which was to be used
on foot, as Lord Dillon points out, did not exist at this period,
and the figure was seated on the Burgundian horse armour of
repoussé steel of the time of Henry VII., which still stands next<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_71" id="a_Page_71">[Pg 71]</a><br /><a name="a_Page_72" id="a_Page_72">[Pg 72]</a><br /><a name="a_Page_73" id="a_Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
to it in the Tower. The engraving on the horse armour or bard
is designed in the same spirit as that of the armour itself, but is
by an inferior hand. The subjects are treated in the style of
Albert Dürer or Burgkmair, and represent incidents in the lives
of St. George and St. Barbara, and besides the badges on the armour
which are reproduced, the castle and the rose and pomegranate impaled
appear, with the motto <span class="small">DIEV ET MON DROYT</span> many times repeated round
the edge. All these badges and engravings were illustrated, almost real
size, by Meyrick, in the twenty-second volume of <i>Archæologia</i>. The
horse armour was silvered and probably parcel gilt, like the body armour,
and was made, it is supposed, by some of the German armourers brought
over and established in Greenwich by Henry VIII. It is stiff and
unwieldy, and does not very efficiently protect the horse, though its effect
is dignified and even magnificent. The singular construction of the
helmet has already been alluded to.</p>

<p>Contemporary with these suits is the fine German late Gothic fluted
armour, known as Maximilian, nearly perfect examples of which are to
be seen in every collection of importance. This was used for tilts, with
the immensely massive outwork of plates to fend off the blows of the
lance and other weapons, and to prevent the left leg from being crushed
against the barrier. Some of the rarer Maximilian suits not only
reproduce the cloth skirts of the civil costume in steel, but also
innumerable puffings and slashings, which were the fashion of the
day. Sometimes the helmets belonging to these suits have the mask-shaped
visors, a specimen of which, also a present to Henry VIII.
from Maximilian, still exists in the Tower. This formed part of a
tilting harness, and is described in the 1547 inventory as &ldquo;a hedde pece
w<sup>t</sup> a Rammes horne silver pcell guilte.&rdquo; In 1660 it was attributed to
Will Sommers, the king&rsquo;s jester, and has subsequently been rendered
more grotesque by paint and a pair of spectacles. A complete helmet
of the same kind is preserved at Warwick Castle, as well as one of the
rarer Italian helmets, with curling woolly hair represented in embossed
iron, but without the visor.</p>

<p>All this armour was made for the shocks and pleasurable excitement
of jousts, tilts, and tourneys, which its perfection and strength
deprived of nearly every element of danger. Its weight and closeness<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_74" id="a_Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
would indeed have made it insupportable on active service. The great
revolution in the equipments for war, commenced by the artillery train
and nearly unarmoured pikeman and estradiot, was now being completed by
the reiter, pistolier and arquebusier. The massed man-at-arms, armed
cap-à-pied, had borne down for the last time all before him with the
lance, and was ceasing to play a decisive or even an important part in
warfare. Armour in campaigning was becoming of little consequence, and
even for the tourney a reaction was setting in against the extravagant
and ponderous precautions devised by Maximilian and his admirer Henry.</p>

<p>The decision of battles now belonged to pike, bill, and musket. The
infantry and light troops, who had hitherto been left to arm themselves
as best they could, began to be dressed in some sort of uniform, with
weapons and armour selected with some care, and used in definite
proportions. It is certainly strange to read that the archers who did such
splendid service at Agincourt were left to pick up any kind of helmet,
bassinet, or cap, whether of leather or wicker bound with iron, and any
description of side-arms, and were mostly without armour, save the pourpoint,
with stockings hanging down or bare feet. Only the bows, arrows,
and stakes were obligatory. In pictures, archers and the foot generally
are represented in every kind of old brigandine, mail, bits of plate, or
&ldquo;jakkes&rdquo; of linen, which inventories tell us were stuffed with horn or
mail. It was only when the kings and nobles thought it worth their
while to clothe and equip the foot-soldier that his costume became distinctive,
and even sumptuous in the case of the bodyguards to Charles
VII., Louis XI., or Henry VII. and VIII. A larger proportion of archers
became mounted as the fifteenth century wore on, Edward IV. invading
France with no less than 14,000, besides the foot. Picked men, and those
of the bodyguards of kings and princes, like the Duke of Burgundy,
were sometimes magnificently dressed. The uniform of the archers of
the Duke of Berri in 1465 was a brigandine covered with black velvet
and gilt nails, and a hood ornamented with silver gilt tassels. At
the entry into Rouen, 1460, the archers of the King of France, the
King of Sicily and the Duke of Maine wore plate-armour under jackets
of various colours, with greaves, swords, daggers and helms rich with
silversmiths&rsquo; work. The leaders of other corps were in jackets striped
red, white and green, covered with embroidery. English archers are<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_75" id="a_Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
sometimes spoken of as gallantly accoutred. Under Henry VIII. the
bodyguard called the &ldquo;retinewe of speres&rdquo; comprised two mounted
archers in uniform to each man-at-arms, as in France. Every layman
with an estate of £1000 and upwards had to furnish thirty long-bows,
thirty sheaves of arrows, and thirty steel caps. In 1548 the uniform
of the English archer was a coat of blue cloth guarded with red, right
hose red, the left blue, or both blue with broad red stripes, and a
special cap to be worn over the steel cap or sallad, to be bought in London
for 8d. They were provided with brigandines or coats of little
plates, mawles of lead five feet long, with two stakes, and a dagger. The
distinguishing mark of the various bands was embroidered on the left
sleeve. In 1510 Henry ordered 10,000 bows from the bowyers of London,
and applied for leave to import 40,000 from Venice. In 1513 he
took 12,000 archers to France, and in 1518 agreed to furnish 6000
archers to the emperor. In this reign they did good service, as in
repelling the descent of the French at Brighton, 1515, and at Flodden,
where the King of Scots was found among the dead pierced by an arrow.
Some bow-staves of yew were recovered from the wreck of the <i>Mary
Rose</i>, and are now in the Tower. At Dover Castle there are a long-bow
and a cross-bow, stated to be part of the original armament.</p>

<p>The cross-bow was rarely favoured by Englishmen, though an
imposing force of 4000 appeared in the united forces of England and
Burgundy in 1411, each attended by two varlets to load, so that the
weapons were always ready to shoot. In 1415, however, Henry V. only
took ninety-eight from England in his whole force of 10,500 men,
eighteen of whom were mounted. In 1465 the so-called mounted
archers were very variously armed in France, with cross-bows, veuglaires,
and hand culverins.</p>

<p>If so formidable a body as the English archers could be left to their
own devices as to accoutrements in the first half of the century, the rest
of the foot, armed with long weapons called staves, bills, and halbards,
must have presented the appearance of a mere rabble. The French
foot, armed with partisans, halbards, or javelins, bore the suggestive
name of &ldquo;brigans,&rdquo; and were much despised, but at Montlhéry in 1465
the greater part of the slaughter was by the &ldquo;rascally Burgundian foot,&rdquo;
with their pikes and other weapons tipped with iron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_76" id="a_Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>The Swiss victory at Morat in 1476 undoubtedly led the French,
and later the English, to introduce a disciplined infantry armed with
the pike as a serious element into the army. In 1480 the French took
the extreme course of disbanding the whole body of archers, substituting
Swiss pikemen, and causing a prodigious number of pikes,
halbards, and daggers to be made by the cutlers. Thus in 1482 the
army of Picardy is composed of no more than 1400 men-at-arms,
6000 Swiss, and 8000 pikes. The proportions in England, ten
years later, may be gauged by the Earl of Surrey&rsquo;s contingent of five
men-at-arms, each with cushet and page, twelve demi-lances, twenty
archers mounted, forty-six on foot, and thirteen bills. The archers
remained an important force with us till long after Henry VIII., but it
is only in his reign that the billmen and halbardiers occupy a definite
position in the country&rsquo;s armed forces. These were armed with bill,
sword, shield, sallad, and corselet. The costume of the foot and even
the yeomen of the guard, 1000 strong under Henry VIII., changed
with the civil dress, but always included the royal badge and crown.
Henry proceeded to the siege of Boulogne in the midst of his pikemen
with fifty mounted archers on the right and fifty mounted gunners on
the left. Their costumes are seen in the Hampton Court pictures. In
1598 it was scarlet profusely spangled. Under Philip and Mary they
were an even more important force, and under Elizabeth the backbone
of the army was its pikemen, billmen, and harquebusiers, now armed,
as in France, with Milanese corselets and morions. The bill was six feet
long, of native production, the head at least twelve inches long, and bound
with iron like the halbard, which was shorter, to at least the middle of the
staff. The black bills were also shorter and from Germany, but the
best halbards were Milanese. The partisan with us seems to have been
more a weapon of parade, various in form, with or without wings, and
richly decorated with engraving, painting, and gilding. The pike was
eighteen to twenty-two feet long, with a tassel to prevent the water
running down. The &ldquo;Staves&rdquo; in the Tower under Henry VIII. included
20,100 morris pikes, some highly decorated, and 2000 javelins, mostly
richly mounted, as if for the Court guards. The army taken to France
in 1513 comprised, according to the Venetian ambassador, 6000 halbardiers
and 12,000 men with holy-water sprinklers, a weapon never seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_77" id="a_Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
before, six feet long, surmounted by a ball with six steel spikes. The
name was a quaint joke, like the Flemish Godendag or the Swiss Wasistdas
and Morgenstern. Besides these there were tridents, pole-axes, collen
cleves, boar-spears, rawcons, partisans, and other forms of staff weapons
in smaller quantities.</p>

<p>An English army sometimes comprised light cavalry even in the
earliest times, perhaps none more singular than a miserably-accoutred
force of mounted Irish armed with target, short javelin, and great outlandish
knives, but without using saddles, in the reign of Henry V.
The army of Henry VIII. in 1513 comprised 9000 to 10,000 heavy
barbed cavalry and 8000 light horse, and 2000 mounted archers. His
&ldquo;Retinewe of speres&rdquo; comprised a page, a cushet with javelin or demi-lance,
and two archers, all mounted, to each man-at-arms. An English
force of about 400 demi-lances serving Henri II. in 1552 &ldquo;for their
pleasure,&rdquo; were in short petticoats, red bonnets, body with brassarts of
plate, and high leather boots above the knee, mounted on swift little
horses and armed with a lance like a demi-pike.</p>

<p>The infantry, though not yet a permanent standing force, except in
the case of the Royal bodyguards, was now a recognised arm into which
men enlisted as a professional career for the term of their lives or until
disabled. To handle the pike or arquebus efficiently required long
training, and veterans were always accepted before recruits. It was their
steadiness and power of man&oelig;uvring in action that lessened the value of
heavy cavalry, and consequently contributed, more than any other circumstance,
to the rapid disuse of the cap-à-pied suit of armour in the
field, so noticeable in the next chapter.</p>

<h2><a name="a_V" id="a_V">V</a><br />
<i>The Age of Enriched Armour</i></h2>


<p>Armour began from about the accession of Edward VI. to cease to
be a military necessity, and those engaged in practical warfare were more
ready to dispense with its doubtful protection than to encumber themselves
with its certain disadvantages. Excuses were found for appearing
in the field without armour, or with an imperfect equipment, and
punishments were inflicted in the vain attempt to stem the tide of
change. Those who served on foot had naturally the strongest objection
to bearing its weight, since when opposed to firearms it ceased to have
any practical utility. A battle-scene at Hampton Court, the battle of
Forty by Snayers, furnishes the strongest justification for its disuse among
men-at-arms. It represents a number of mounted men in complete
armour, who discharge horse-pistols point blank at each other&rsquo;s breastplates,
the individual struck falling in every case dead or wounded from
his horse. The wheel-lock pistol, the arm of the German Reiters, who
wore black armour, mail sleeves, and a visored morion, was in the field
in 1512. From this time, therefore, armour was worn rather for display
than service, and the purchaser came to value its defensive qualities
far less than the magnificence of its decoration. Nor was ostentation
in arms confined to the noble or knight alone. Brantôme says that
among the pikemen and musketeers of Strozzi, De Brissac, and the
Duc de Guise, thousands of gilt and engraved morions and corselets
were to be seen on parade days, and the armour worn by the picked
force of Spaniards and Italians sent by Philip of Spain to occupy the
Netherlands was a splendid sight. The great and wealthy have seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_79" id="a_Page_79">[Pg 79]</a><br /><a name="a_Page_80" id="a_Page_80">[Pg 80]</a><br /><a name="a_Page_81" id="a_Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
cared to stint in matters of personal adornment, and in days when there
were fewer ways in which a taste for extravagant expenditure could be
combined with a high appreciation of art, fortunes were spent upon the
coverings of the body. Nothing more sumptuous in applied art exists, in
regard either to design or execution, than the work lavished on the armour
produced for the French, Spanish, and other monarchs in the second half
of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth centuries. Among this
the most exquisitely beautiful is the damascened work, scattered over
Europe, persistently though erroneously attributed to Cellini, of which,
perhaps, one of the finest examples is the target at Windsor. It is no
exaggeration to say that neither chiselling, embossing, nor damascening
on metal has ever rivalled or even approached that bestowed at this time
upon royal arms and armour. The chief seats of production were in
Germany and Italy, at Milan above all, then Innsbrück, Augsburg,
Nuremberg; and in a less degree Florence, Brescia and Venice. It is
singular that few fine suits can be attributed to France, and fewer still
either to Spain, the Netherlands, or England. The youth of Edward,
the fact that female sovereigns succeeded, and finally, the timidity and
horror of war felt by James, account for none of the known chef-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre
suits being made for English wearers. Such extraordinary and magnificent
armour was meet for none but the high-spirited and rival
princes of Europe, and no king distinguished for valour occupied the
throne of England during the period when enriched armour reached
its culminating point of grandeur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span>&mdash;<i>Part of a suit made for Sir Christopher Hatton.</i></p>

<p>From the Spitzer collection, and now in the possession of Mr. Charles Davis. This is No. 15 in the Armourers&rsquo;
Album in the South Kensington Museum, reproduced in our <a href="#a_plate_3">Plate III.</a></p></div>

<p>There are, however, a certain number of richly engraved and gilt suits
which have been in the possession of English families from time immemorial,
and the fortunate acquisition for the South Kensington Museum
Art Library of an Armourers&rsquo; Album of the time of Elizabeth, has
enabled many of the original wearers of them to be identified. This MS.,
as Lord Dillon relates, was in the possession, in 1790, of the Duchess of
Portland, daughter of Harley, Earl of Oxford, who permitted Pennant to
engrave from it a suit of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, for his
account of London; while Strutt was allowed to reproduce that of
George, Earl of Cumberland, for his work on dresses and costumes.
The book undoubtedly once formed part of the great Harleian Library,
but was lost until seen in Paris some years ago by Baron de Cosson. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_82" id="a_Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
was sold at the Spitzer sale, acquired by M. Stein, and offered to the
Kensington Museum, by whom it was wisely purchased.</p>

<p>The drawings are in pen and ink and water-colours and represent
twenty-nine full suits, besides the extra pieces for tilting. Some
of them are inscribed &ldquo;Made by me Jacobe,&rdquo; the name of the master
armourer at Greenwich during part of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, and mentioned
by Sir Henry Lee, the Master of the Armoury, in a letter to the Lord
Treasurer, dated 12th October 1590, published by Lord Dillon in the
fifty-first volume of <i>Archæologia</i>. Wendelin Böheim, the curator of the
Imperial collections of armour at Vienna, has recently identified this
Jacobe with Jacob Topf, one of three brothers, natives of Innsbrück or
its vicinity, and who suddenly appears as court armourer in 1575. This
post he seems to have retained and worked at Schloss Ambras till his
death in 1597. Suits made by him during this period for the Archduke
Ferdinand of Tyrol and Archduke Charles of Styria certainly bear some
resemblance to those in the Album. Böheim infers from the Italian
influence seen in his work, especially in the ornament, that Topf must
have proceeded from the atelier of Jörg Seusenhofer to Milan or Brescia,
about the year 1558, and taken up his abode in England between 1562
and 1575.</p>

<p>To support the identification of the Jacobe of the Album with Jacob
Topf of Innsbrück, it is necessary either that all the suits should have
been produced before 1575, or that those made at a later time should be
regarded as by some other hand. The first two, for Rutland and Bedford,
who died respectively in 1563 and 1564, are relatively plain, and have
M.R. over them, and the rest E.R., which can only, it would appear,
have reference to the initials of the reigning queens. All the figures
are practically drawn from one model, though sometimes reversed, and
are in an easy and graceful pose. Two of the richest, namely the second
suit for Sir Henry Lee, the Master Armourer, No. 19, and the first suit
of Sir Christopher Hatton, No. 15 of the Album, are here reproduced in
facsimile, though reduced in scale (Plates II. and III.). One holds a mace
and the other a truncheon in one hand, with the butt resting upon the hip,
while the other arm is bent and the extended palm rests upon the thigh.
They wear the close helmet or armet of Italian fashion, with a high comb
and a large sharply-pointed visor. The gorgets are laminated, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_83" id="a_Page_83">[Pg 83]</a><br /><a name="a_Page_84" id="a_Page_84">[Pg 84]</a><br /><a name="a_Page_85" id="a_Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
pauldrons large and massive, the breastplates long-waisted, known as
the peascod shape, ending in a point, with a ridge down the centre
called the tapul; the tassets are short and laminated. Only the front
of the thigh is protected by laminated cuissarts, and the rest of the
leg by close-fitting knee-caps and greaves. The sollerets are complete
and take the shape of the foot. The swords appear to be simply cross-hilted
and worn in scabbards. Both the suits reproduced are richly
engraved with vertical bands of gilt arabesqued ornament in the Italian
fashion: Sir Christopher Hatton&rsquo;s being on a russet ground with a gold
corded pattern connecting the bands; and Sir Henry Lee&rsquo;s on a white
ground with a knotted reticulated pattern between. The minor details
are considerably varied in the other suits, two of which have been
reproduced by Lord Dillon, and two by Böheim in the publications already
referred to. The complete list comprises the names of many of the
leading nobles and captains of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, only two in it being
foreigners.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>&mdash;<i>Armour of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, 1566-1588. In the Tower.</i></p></div>

<p>The ornament is sufficiently distinct to admit of the suits being
identified where they still exist. Thus the Earl of Pembroke&rsquo;s suit is
still at Wilton, in perfect preservation; the suit of George, Earl of
Cumberland, is in the possession of Lord Hothfield at Appleby Castle.
The grand-guard of this suit, with volant attached, forms the subject of
<a href="#a_plate_4">Plate IV.</a>, in which the original russet and gilding is somewhat restored.
The ornament on the bands is an interlacing strap upon a foliated
arabesque ground, with a figure of Mercury near the top, and two
E&rsquo;s at intervals addorsed and crowned, coupled by a true-lover&rsquo;s knot.
Between are large roses and fleurs-de-lis united by knots. The helmet
of Sir Henry Lee&rsquo;s second suit, <a href="#a_plate_2">Plate II.</a>, is now in the Tower, having
been identified by Lord Dillon, while a locking gauntlet belonging to
it is in the Hall of the Armourers&rsquo; Company. This gauntlet, called
the &ldquo;forbidden gauntlet,&rdquo; was in form of a closed right hand, the
fingers fastened by a hook and staple, leaving an aperture for the passage
of the weapon which, if a lance, or sword with cross-guard and pommel,
could not be dislodged. In the Tower are also the vamplate of Sir
Christopher Hatton&rsquo;s second suit, and the complete armour of the Earl of
Worcester, with both the headpieces. A helmet of Lord Sussex&rsquo;s suit is
in the Tower, and two gauntlets belonging to it were in the Spitzer sale.<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_86" id="a_Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Lord Bucarte&rsquo;s suit is in the Wallace collection at Hertford House, and
another fine suit is in Armourers&rsquo; Hall.</p>

<p>The first Sir Christopher Hatton suit, <a href="#a_plate_3">Plate III.</a>, has also recently
reached this country, fortunately in almost perfect condition. It was
disposed of in the Spitzer sale, and was purchased by Mr. Davies of
New Bond Street. It will be a misfortune if this historic piece is not
added to the national collection. <a href="#a_fig30">Fig. 30</a> represents the upper part
of this suit, taken from a photograph, with the high neck-guards
attached to the pauldrons. The original front-plate seems to be lost,
but the extra breastplate for tilting and some other extra pieces are
preserved.</p>

<p>If Boheim is correct in his identification of Jacobe with Jacob Topf,
and in his dates, the armour in the Album must be by different hands.
Thus Topf, arriving in 1562, could hardly have made the first two suits
marked M.R., the owners of which died, as we have mentioned, in 1563
and 1564 respectively. The mail defence for the instep and the relatively
broad toes are features of an earlier time, which the letters M.R. identify
as that of Mary, and show that the very broad stirrup of Henry VIII.
was still in use. Neither could he, being settled in Innsbrück or at
Ambras in 1575, have made the suits for Sir Henry Lee, as Master of
the Armoury; nor that for Sir Thomas Bromley, as Lord Chancellor,
though the latter suit may have been for Sir Nicholas Bacon, the previous
Lord Chancellor. The chief difficulty is the date of Sir Henry Lee&rsquo;s
appointment, which Lord Dillon in his able treatise, in the <i>Archæological
Journal</i> for June 1895, gives as 1580, and the fact that the solitary
mention of Jacobe in any document is by Sir Henry Lee himself, and
is dated October 1590, in which he speaks of him as &ldquo;the M<sup>r</sup> workman
of Grenewhyche,&rdquo; and in a way that could not well have reference to
one who had quitted the post fifteen years before. These difficulties
may, however, it is possible, yet be reconciled.</p>

<p>Among the fine suits in the Tower is the equestrian armour of Robert
Dudley, Earl of Leicester (<a href="#a_fig31">Fig. 31</a>), not however one of the suits in the
Album. It is, like the Jacobe suits, banded in the Italian fashion, with a
similar kind of design upon the bands, and between them a broad impressed
diaper of crossed ragged staves and leaves filled with fine arabesques.
Among the enrichments can also be seen the George of the Garter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_87" id="a_Page_87">[Pg 87]</a><br /><a name="a_Page_88" id="a_Page_88">[Pg 88]</a><br /><a name="a_Page_89" id="a_Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the bear and ragged staff, the initials R.D., and the collar of the Order
of St. Michael and St. George, conferred upon this favourite of Queen
Elizabeth in 1566. In the illustration of this suit, <a href="#a_fig31">Fig. 31</a>, the bear
and ragged staff is plainly visible on the horse&rsquo;s chamfron, from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_90" id="a_Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
issues a twisted spike. The armet is combed, but differs in form from
the Jacobe type, and the visor is pierced on one side with round holes.
In other respects the fashion of the armour is very similar to that of his
enemy, Sir Christopher Hatton. The grand-guard and pass-guard or
elbow-guard are preserved with it. The former is illustrated, <a href="#a_plate_5">Plate V.</a>,
with its original gilding restored, the military cleaning and scouring to
which it has been subjected for so many years, not wisely but too well,
having obliterated every trace of the original splendour of colour. A
portrait of the Earl in this very suit exists, however, to show what it was.
He died, it is well known, in 1588.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span>&mdash;<i>Italian suit of blued and gilded steel covered with appliqués of gold. In the Guard-chamber
of Windsor Castle.</i></p></div>

<p>Several splendid and historic suits are preserved in the Guard-room
at Windsor Castle. Among these, one, the suit of Prince Henry of
Wales, son of James I. (<a href="#a_plate_1">frontispiece</a>), bears a remarkable resemblance
to the Jacobe suits, recalling especially the design of the Cumberland
suit, <a href="#a_plate_4">Plate IV.</a> But for the alternation of thistles among the fleurs-de-lis
and roses between the bands of gilded ornament, the body armour in
both would be nearly identical. The monogram H.P. appears on the
gilt bands of strap and arabesque work. The gilding is in fine preservation,
and except that the steel was formerly a deep blue, in the Milanese
fashion, it is still as represented in the portrait of Prince Henry in
the possession of the Marquis of Lothian. It has been attributed
to William Pickering, Master of the Armourers&rsquo; Company of London
in 1608-9, on the faith of some payments made to him, which Mr.
St. John Hope has noted as follows: &ldquo;In March 1613, a warrant issued
under sign manual, for the payment to Sir Edward Cecil of a balance
of £300 due for armour value £450 for the late Prince Henry: and
in July 1614 a warrant issued to pay William Pickering, Master of the
Armoury at Greenwich, £200 balance of £340 for armour gilt and
graven for the late Prince.&rdquo; The helmet somewhat resembles that of
the Leicester suit, but has a singularly stiff, vertically-ridged gorget
with scalloped edge, and heavier gauntlets. The leg-defences and sollerets
do not differ appreciably from those already noticed. A number of the
extra pieces and some of the horse armour belonging to the suit are
preserved with it. If really by Pickering he was a close copyist of
Jacobe. An apparently companion suit of Prince Charles is looked on
with suspicion by Lord Dillon. Another of Prince Henry&rsquo;s suits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_91" id="a_Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
presented by the Prince de Joinville, and now in the Tower, was originally
of blued steel richly ornamented with classical designs in gold.
There are also in the Tower a fine suit made for Charles I. when a boy,
some silvered pieces, and the richly gilt and engraved armour presented
to him by the City of London.</p>

<p>Another suit at Windsor of extraordinary magnificence is that
represented in <a href="#a_fig32">Fig. 32</a>. It is, unfortunately, not well set up, and differs
considerably in construction from those hitherto noticed, and is of later
date than the Jacobe suits. The tassets are replaced by laminar cuissarts
extending to the knee, below which the suit is not continued. The
ornament is banded vertically, like that of the suits previously figured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_92" id="a_Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
but is of a richer character. Its details and colouring are reproduced
on a larger scale in the helmet, <a href="#a_plate_6">Plate VI.</a>, which is combed, fluted, and of
singularly graceful outline, with all its fastenings, plume-holders, and
the stiffly-ribbed gorget in most perfect condition. The whole appears
to be a specimen of rare French armour, but nothing is known of its
history. Even more sumptuous, if possible, is the Italian suit, <a href="#a_fig33">Fig. 33</a>,
which also exhibits some peculiar characters, such as the single plates
in place of the tassets and the construction of the arm-defences and
gauntlets. The setting up in this suit is also unfortunately defective.
The extraordinary richness of the damascening and appliqué work is
reproduced in <a href="#a_fig34">Fig. 34</a>, in which a portion is sketched real size. Nearly
all the escutcheon-like appliqués have been picked off at some period,
either for mischief or for the gold. The original owner of this suit is
also unknown, but it may, with the one last described, have possibly
been a present to Prince Henry, whose passion for military exercises
and display is matter of history. The last of our illustrations (<a href="#a_fig35">Fig. 35</a>)
taken from suits in the Windsor Guard-chamber is a demi-suit of the
Earl of Essex, and is a war suit, something like a pikeman&rsquo;s, except that
the closed helmet was not worn by dismounted men. This is combed,
and introduces a shade or peak over the sight. It has no visor, but a
bavier in two pieces protects the face. It should perhaps be described
as a burgonet with gorget and movable mentonières. Probably only
a part of the suit is present, that for use on foot, and the helmet may
belong to the missing equipment for a rider, or if worn on foot it would
have been as an open burgonet. The Jacobe Album introduces us to
the burgonet and cabasset, a lighter morion, and shows that these were
used when fighting on foot by even the greatest captains. This suit is
also decorated in bands, a fashion almost universal during the reign of
Elizabeth. The breastplate is the peascod with tapul form, and the
cuissarts &ldquo;à écrivisse&rdquo; form the only protection for the legs. The
ornament is more finely and delicately chased than that of any suit yet
noticed. The design on the bands is an interlacing and knotted strap,
filled with arabesqued foliage enclosing medallions with emblematic
figures and flowers encircled by mottoes, as Futura præteritis, on a
ground etched down, but with foliage and bright points like grains of
seed, left on it. A part of this ornament is drawn full size in <a href="#a_plate_7">Plate VII.</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_93" id="a_Page_93">[Pg 93]</a><br /><a name="a_Page_94" id="a_Page_94">[Pg 94]</a><br /><a name="a_Page_95" id="a_Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
There is a suit in the Tower attributed to the same Robert Devereux,
Earl of Essex, who was executed in 1601, also richly engraved and gilt.</p>

<p>The suits now divided between Windsor and the Tower evidently
formed part of a single collection. Those at Windsor are placed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_96" id="a_Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
brackets at such a height that they can only be inspected from a ladder,
and they sadly require setting up, in the way that Lord Dillon has
mounted those in the Tower. It is perhaps unfortunate that the
national collection of armour is so scattered, parts being, besides the
great collections at the Tower and Windsor, in the British and South
Kensington Museums, Hertford House, Woolwich Rotunda, and Dover
Castle, while most of the earlier English and historic pieces are still in
churches and cathedrals. If brought together, properly displayed and
added to in a reasonable manner by the purchase of such suits as that
recently sold in the Spitzer sale, a suit of fine quality and directly
connected with our national history, it might become worthy the country,
and rank in time with the great armouries of Vienna, Paris, Madrid,
Turin, or Dresden.</p>

covered with raised gold damascened work on blue steel matrix; except
the grip of silver wire work. Preserved in Windsor Castle.</p></div>

<p>Besides the half-dozen really magnificent suits in the Guard-chamber
at Windsor, there is a vast collection of arms and weapons in the North
Corridor, formed in a great measure by Her Majesty. Among these are
three swords intimately connected with our history. Of these, that of
Charles I. has a pommel and guard of steel overlaid with raised gold
damascening, and a grip covered with silver wire woven like basket-work
(<a href="#a_plate_8">Plate VIII.</a>). The blade is decorated with Latin inscriptions in
Roman capitals along both margins, back and front, and in circles at
intervals. Between these are panels, alternately of emblems and ornament,
and of arabesqued scrolls, damascened so minutely that the work is
almost invisible until magnified. The small portion of the blade in our
figure shows the character of the work. The royal arms, Prince of
Wales&rsquo; feathers, and date 1616 on the blade show that it was made for
Charles I. when Prince of Wales. The second sword, with the magnificently-worked
basket hilt of chased gold inlay on steel (<a href="#a_fig36">Fig. 36</a>), has
a similar blade, marvellously fine arabesques taking the place of the
marginal inscriptions. It is otherwise nearly identical with the last, the
spread eagles, griffins, etc., being common to both. The presence of
the lion of England under a royal crown points to James I. as its owner.
The third sword (<a href="#a_fig37">Fig. 37</a>) is that of John Hampden. Its blade is plain,
but the hilt is of superb workmanship and of carved steel. The grip is
small, and, like the pear-shaped pommel, covered with warriors in relief
in Roman dress. The quillons are slightly curved, and carved with<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_97" id="a_Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
pomegranates and foliage, with figures reclining horizontally to form the
extremities. The smaller front guard over the blade, known as the
&ldquo;pas-d&rsquo;âne,&rdquo; and most elaborately worked with figures and medallions, is
a prominent feature of the hilt. All three swords bear the unicorn&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="a_Page_98" id="a_Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
head mark of Nuremberg, but the two enriched blades can be identified,
thanks to the assistance of Baron de Cosson, as the work of Clemens
Horn of Solingen, 1580-1625. There is a similar sword in the Royal
Armoury at Madrid, belonging to the suits made by Desiderius Kolman
for Philip II., and another is in the Baron&rsquo;s own collection. The sword,
as the emblem of knightly honour and faith, was from the remotest times
a vehicle for the richest decoration; but it is doubtful whether any
specimens were ever produced, even by the combined efforts of the
swordsmith and jeweller, to equal the work of those here represented,
which are not only connected with the history of our country, but happily
also the property of the nation.</p>

<h2><a name="b_I" id="b_I">I</a><br />
INTRODUCTORY</h2>


<p>A former monograph, <i>Armour in England</i>, treated of weapons and
armour made either in this country or connected historically with English
wearers. The more extensive field of foreign armour brought into England
by wealthy and enthusiastic collectors is now embraced.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm felt for armour is not surprising; its interest is so
many-sided. Not only are collectors fascinated by it, but students
of history, artists, and antiquaries. As mere decoration it appeals to
some, and finds a place in their abodes; but it is among artistic people
that its more ardent admirers are found. Hence it is far from rare to
find the glint of arms and weapons lighting up the artist&rsquo;s walls.</p>

<p>From the artistic standpoint nothing can be more picturesque than
the varied forms assumed by armour and weapons in obedience to the all-powerful
dictates of self-preservation, or to the more arbitrary changes of
fashion. To realise what these changes mean, to appropriate them to the
scenes and episodes of history, belongs to the painter, sculptor, and scenic
artist. If anything in art should be accurately portrayed, it is the men
and the events which make up history. Historic painting and sculpture,
which might live long in art, may be disregarded by posterity owing to
the anachronisms due to neglect of this important study. Most of the
changes were perhaps efforts to avert the recurrence of some accident in
the lists or field of battle. To definitely track them to their actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_6" id="b_Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
origin, to seek out the causes for the singular and ceaseless modifications
arms and armour have undergone, is, however, work only possible to the
antiquary. It is his province to open the door to the artist.</p>

<p>The quality of the art lavished as decoration on the gala suits of
princes and nobles is superb. In mediæval days it was the prerogative
of the male sex, the fighting sex, to deck itself like a game bird in
gorgeous plumage; women&rsquo;s raiment was more subdued. To the male,
no richness of dress that ingenuity could invent or wealth procure was
denied. In preparation for those stately festivals when the courtier was
to shine in the presence of the fair sex, his sovereign, and his peers,
nothing was spared. The armour of parade intended for royal jousts
and tournaments is as sumptuous as the wit of man could devise, with
time and money unstinted. Chasing, embossing, engraving, damascening,
and gilding of the most exquisite quality were lavished upon it, the designs,
and possibly the actual work, being by the best artists of the day. The
later suits, when cap-à-pie armour was mainly consecrated to festivals and
little regarded in battle, were especially loaded with decoration. Besides
its excellence of design and richness of ornament, the mere craftsmanship
of the armour itself is of a quality that never can be excelled, and the
modern counterfeiter, with all his skill and appliances, is baffled in the
reproduction of <i>tours-de-force</i>, such as the high-combed morions of Italy
and Spain.</p>

<p>To study the evolution of armour is like observing the works of
nature. Necessity, it is well known, is the great stimulator of the
inventive faculty of man, and no necessity is more cogent than that of
self-preservation. In the long trials of skill, in which for generation
after generation the armourer was pitted against the guilds concerned in
the production of lethal weapons, the means of defence seemed once or
twice so entirely perfected as to defy the weapons of the assailants. But
ere long, the attacking forces, gathering energy, calling on the ingenuity
of bowyers, fletchers, sword- and gun-smiths, seem again to emerge
triumphant, armed with yet more deadly and powerful weapons. The
struggle on the one hand to encase the man, like Achilles, in invulnerable
armour, and on the other to break down his armour of proof, was
like that between the gunners and naval architects to-day, but it lasted
for centuries. It ended, as all such struggles must, in the complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_7" id="b_Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
discomfiture of the armourer; the increasing use and accuracy of firearms
finally reducing defensive armour to a costly incumbrance. Nature,
indeed, seems to will that all things, animate or inanimate, should
succumb to persistent attack. Viewed in its true light, armour reveals
all the stages, and is the very embodiment of, perhaps, the most prolonged
and determined struggle that the development of civilisation has witnessed.
It presents a gauge of the extent and limitation of man&rsquo;s inventive
faculties, in other words, of his brain capacity, in the ages so-called
mediæval.</p>

<p>Concerning the history of the vast bulk of the armour that falls into
the possession of the collector, all is speculation, and its very nationality
perhaps matter of conjecture. The place whence it has come is often
purposely concealed by the dealer, and a legend concocted to invest it
with a higher market value. The weapon may have played its part in
the stern realities of war; the armour may have saved its owner, or,
failing in the hour of need, contributed to the deaths of those who trusted
to it. Little armour perished with the wearer. Next to gold and silver,
the harvest of arms was the most coveted spoil of victory, and none
remained ungleaned on the battle-field. What harvests such holocausts
as Flodden Field must have presented, affording opportunities of refitting
to the man-at-arms, archer, hobiler, billman, down to the rapacious camp-follower.
Though etiquette may have hindered the squire of low degree
from donning the full cap-à-pie armour of the knight he overcame, no
doubt many a captor of rich armour sacrificed life to indulgence in the
dangerous vanity of dressing beyond his station.</p>

<p>The historic and personal associations connected with the arms and
weapons present at, and by whose agency were enacted, the decisive
battles, the most stirring incidents of history humanity can witness,
are not the least of the many-sided interests of armour.</p>

<p>Though but a small proportion of the vast number of suits, helmets,
and weapons that have come down to us can be assigned to definite
wearers, and most of even these were but the parade suits of royalty and
the court, the few pieces of real actual fighting armour identified with
particular owners are invested with extraordinary interest. Most of these
owe their preservation to the ancient and poetic custom of hanging the
arms of knightly personages over their tombs, a custom linked with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_8" id="b_Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
still older dedication of arms and armour at the obsequies of the dead,
either by placing them in the grave or hanging them in the temples of
the gods. The reality of the connection between the pagan and Christian
customs is apparent by such incidents as that of William of Toulouse,
early in the thirteenth century, who dedicated his helm, shield, and
weapons to St. Julian, hanging them over his shrine; or that of the King
of France, who, after the battle of Cassel in 1327, presented his victorious
arms to the neighbouring church. The churches in fact ought to have
been the great treasure-houses for actual armour, as they are of representations
of armour on monuments and brasses. Unfortunately, however,
the old veneration for the person of the dead which led to the consecration
of the armour and weapons he had actually used, hardly survived the
close of the thirteenth century. Cupidity induced the prelate to claim
them as a perquisite of the burial function, as when the Prior of
Westminster received £100 as ransom for the horse and accoutrements of
John of Eltham; while the temptation natural to the survivor to retain the
finely tempered weapons and armour, whose quality had been tested in
the field, had always to be reckoned with. This reluctance to sacrifice
them is beautifully expressed in such ancient ballads as those on the
death of King Arthur.</p>

<p>Armour was moreover specially devised by will to be kept as heirlooms.
Grose in the <i>Antiquities</i> states that Thomas Beauchamp, Earl of
Warwick in the time of Henry IV., left to his son Richard by will the
sword and coat of mail said to belong to the celebrated Guy, Earl of
Warwick, he having received them as an heir-loom from his father. Sir
Thomas Poynings, in 1369, devised to his heir the helmet and armour
which his father devised to him. It also became penal to make away
with armour. Enactments, such as that of 1270, commanded that all
armour was to be viewed and kept in safe keeping under good security
not to be let go, for the king&rsquo;s use at reasonable valuation. The custom,
which prevailed extensively, of leaving the undertaker to provide property
helmets and arms in place of those the departed had himself used, also
tended to lessen the interest of even the arms which yet remain. That the
helmet of Henry V. was provided by the undertaker is well known, and
that he continued to provide arms down to Elizabeth&rsquo;s time, is shown
by accounts of funerals such as of Lord Grey de Wilton in 1562, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_9" id="b_Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
among the items of the undertaker&rsquo;s bill are a &ldquo;cote of arms,&rdquo; banner
and bannerolles, a &ldquo;helmett of stele gylt with fyne golde,&rdquo; with a crest
gilt and coloured, a &ldquo;swerde with the hyltes, pomell, chape, buckle, and
pendant, likewise gylte, with a gurdle and sheathe of velvet.&rdquo; This
custom of substituting spurious insignia at the solemn interment of the
dead was set by the Church, who consigned mock croziers and chalices of
no intrinsic value to the graves of even the most exalted prelates. But
of the true and the spurious armour alike, time, rust, and above all,
changes of religious sentiment in regard to the churches, have spared
little besides an occasional helmet. The claims of neighbouring magnates,
to the custody of what they regard as family relics, the temptation to
sell, and lack of interest, have further sadly reduced this residue within
the present century.</p>

<p>Yet neglect and depredations notwithstanding, the preservation of
nearly all the English fighting helms known, from the time of the Black
Prince to that of Henry VIII., and of many swords of early date, is due
to their having been deposited in churches. Other magnificent fourteenth
and even thirteenth century swords owe their preservation to their
inclusion in the insignia of Municipal Corporations. Lincoln, Bristol,
Kingston on Hull, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Southampton, Gloucester, Hereford,
Exeter, Chester, Coventry, are among the cities still possessing
these interesting relics.</p>

<p>If our national collections are less imposing than those of Spain,
Austria, Italy, France, and Germany, the enthusiasm of wealthy amateurs
has made this country second to none in the richness of its private
collections of European arms and armour.</p>

<p>Of collections commenced and handed down from the time that
armour was still in use, by far the most important is the Tower
Armoury. Its history can be gathered from Lord Dillon&rsquo;s paper in
the fifty-first volume of <i>Archæologia</i>, &ldquo;Arms and Armour at Westminster,
the Tower, and Greenwich.&rdquo; The collection had its origin
in Henry VIII.&rsquo;s passion for arms and armour, which was ministered
to by Continental sovereigns, especially Maximilian, who shared this
taste, and with whom he maintained a close friendship. His extensive
array of tilting and jousting suits was kept at Greenwich, and an
inventory taken of them upon his death. They were not removed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_10" id="b_Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the Tower until perhaps 1644, though the armoury there was already,
during the reign of Henry, one of the sights of London. The arms
stored at Westminster were probably removed to the Tower as early as
the beginning of the reign of Edward VI. The armoury was no doubt
regarded more as an arsenal for use, than in the light of a collection, and
perhaps was drawn upon constantly until the Civil Wars, when it was
extensively depleted. Five of the Greenwich complete suits of Henry
VIII. still exist, however, three mounted upon barded horses, as well as
other pieces. The collection becoming on its removal a national one,
several suits of distinguished nobles of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, and some of the
royal armour of the Stuarts, were added. During the present century
attempts to render it more complete have been made, by purchasing
examples of enriched foreign armour, and more especially of pieces illustrating
the armour of more ancient days. Many of the latter, however,
are now pronounced to be spurious, and none of them are remarkable.</p>

<p>It appears that the Tower collection has been drawn upon, at some
comparatively recent period, for the decoration of Windsor Castle. Some
half-dozen of the richest suits are now in the Guard Chamber. Arrayed
in cases in the north corridor is a most extensive collection of magnificent
weapons, many intimately connected with the history of the country, as
well as a matchless collection of oriental arms and armour, formed to a
large extent from the collection at Carlton House and added to by Her
Majesty.</p>

<p>The Museum of Artillery in the Rotunda at Woolwich contains a
valuable collection of armour and weapons, formed partly from the
Tower collection, and by judicious purchases. The series of Gothic
armour from Rhodes is very remarkable. There are also a few pieces
in the Royal Artillery Institution not far distant, and a small part of the
collection has been placed in Dover Castle.</p>

<p>The British Museum contains a limited but choice collection, chiefly
bequeathed by Mr. Burges, of Mediæval and Renaissance armour, as
well as its unrivalled series of antique arms and weapons.</p>

<p>The South Kensington Museum also possesses a few interesting arms
and weapons, besides collections deposited on loan.</p>

<p>The munificent bequest of the Wallace Collection has put the nation
in possession of a superb series of armour only rivalled by that in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_11" id="b_Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Tower Armoury. It must unfortunately remain inaccessible, being
packed away in cases until the rearrangement of Manchester House is
completed; consequently none of its contents could be illustrated. It
contains perhaps over 1200 specimens, without counting the Oriental
arms, all of them choice and some unsurpassed. It is rich in Gothic, fluted,
and highly decorated armour, and comprises a matchless series of swords
and other weapons. Of private collections in this country that are
historic, the Earl of Warwick&rsquo;s is undoubtedly the most interesting, part
of it having been in the Castle from the days when armour was in
constant use. Besides the few almost legendary pieces, it claims to
contain armour of Lord Brooke, killed at Lichfield, of Montrose, the
target of the Pretender, and Cromwell&rsquo;s helmet.</p>

<p>Among the armour at Wilton House are the superb suits of the
Dukes of Montmorency and Bourbon, captured by the Earl of Pembroke
at the battle of St. Quentin, together with the suit worn by the Earl, and
pictured in the Jacobe Album. With these are a good number of lancers&rsquo;
demi-suits marked with the family initial. The armour of the Earl of
Cumberland, also figured in the Jacobe Album, yet remains in perfect
preservation in the possession of Lord Hothfield. The collection at
Penshurst Castle comprises some good armour, including helmets and
weapons of the Sidneys, its former owners. Sir Wheatman Pearson
possesses the barded suit of fluted armour said to have been worn by a
Talbot of Shrewsbury at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Many other
ancient seats still contain family armour, either relics of the Civil Wars, as
at Littlecote and Farleigh Castle, or removed from the neighbouring
church, or discovered in some attic, vault, or even well, as at Arundel.</p>

<p>The Armourers and Braziers Company possess one of the Jacobe suits
in their small collection; the Benchers of the Middle Temple own some
armour; and there are a few pieces in the United Service Museum in
Whitehall. Mr. Leonard Brassey possesses a fine historic cap-à-pie suit of
the hereditary challengers, the Dymoke family. Some of the Corporation
Museums, especially at Edinburgh, comprise examples of armour and
weapons.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that nearly all the notable private collections made
within the present century have been dispersed, either on the death of
their owners, or before. The Walpole, Bernal, Meyrick, Londesborough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_12" id="b_Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Shrewsbury, Coutts-Lindsay, Brett, De Cosson, and many other collections
have been scattered far and wide under the hammer. The Warwick and
others have suffered severely by fire; and of collections made by the past
generation probably only that of Lord Zouche at Parham remains intact.</p>

<p>A great deal of armour is absorbed as decoration, not only in
such stately homes of the nobility as Arundel, Eaton Hall, Hatfield,
Knebworth, but in private houses. Armour is also hidden away in
small and unknown collections, like two in the writer&rsquo;s family, which
would well repay careful examination. But undoubtedly the richest
treasures are in the collections of wealthy amateurs, like Mr. David
Currie, Sir Noël Paton, and above all in those of members of the
Kernoozer&rsquo;s Club. It is impossible to convey, in a slight sketch, any
adequate idea of the wealth of armour in the country, the real extent of
which is as yet only to be surmised; but in spite of sales it is doubtless
increasing yearly.</p>

<p>The fact cannot be ignored that, of all this mass of armour, very
little has been made in England. By far the larger part was indeed
certainly made in Germany, a country devoted to metal-working from
the earliest periods of its history.</p>

<p>The first dawning of anything like European reputation for the production
of arms and armour, since the collapse of the Roman Empire,
was achieved by Germany. Owing to its political constitution, and
perhaps extent and population, its towns were more enterprising in
mediæval ages than ours, and acquired a name for particular manufactures
at a relatively early period. The necessity the trading towns
were under of arming their citizens to defend their freedom and privileges,
amidst the semi-independent princelings and nobles who kept armed
retainers and combined to levy blackmail, induced many to take up the
manufacture of arms in self-defence, for which they afterwards sought a
market among neighbours and abroad. In the thirteenth century, when
St. Louis bore a German sword to the Crusades, the names of Cologne,
Passau, Heilbronn appear almost simultaneously as seats famous for the
production of lethal weapons. Cologne soon assumed the ascendency, at
least in English eyes, for its weapons are spoken of with respect in many
an early ballad. Thus the battle of Otterbourne is fought &ldquo;with swords
of fyne Collayne,&rdquo; and King Arthur&rsquo;s sword hails from Cologne:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_13" id="b_Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<span class="i0">And all the hilte of precious stone.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Duke of Norfolk having sent for armour out of Germany proves
that its armour was already regarded as of superior excellence in the time
of Richard II. German armour might have been used more largely in
England and at an earlier period, but for want of sympathy, perhaps
inherited from the Crusades. These, which knitted so many of the
races of Europe into close contact, happened not to promote any
<i>camaraderie</i> between Germany and ourselves. Their Crusades were
undertaken independently, or were ill-timed relatively to ours. The
unfortunate differences between Richard and the Archduke of Austria,
which drained our country of so much gold and silver that even the
chalices were melted, rendered Germany unpopular, and the feeling was
not improved by the further great loss of treasure on the abortive
election of Richard of Cornwall as Emperor. Princely intermarriages
were unable to effect a union of hearts, for the Kings of Almayne never
come out well in contemporary poetry. Nor was the perpetual presence
of enterprising Hansa merchants in factories, such as the London Steleyard,
calculated to promote good feeling, though introducing a large
bulk of German goods into the country. Steel, itself a German word,
was certainly amongst the imports, probably not only as a raw product,
but manufactured into articles such as the &ldquo;Colleyne clowystes&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Cullen cleavers,&rdquo; and possibly sometimes defensive armour as well.
Until late in the fifteenth century, however, the differences between the
military equipment of Germany and England is more marked than
between that of England and France, which country with the Netherlands
formed a natural barrier that only strong common interests would
effectively bridge. When bonds of trade began to knit peoples together,
German armour, from its excellent quality, divided the market of the
world with Italy. The accession of Henry VIII. opened the English
market wide to it, his ambition to again dismember France, his alliance
with Maximilian and relationship to Charles V. leading to distinct
<i>rapprochements</i>. Natural inclination and political necessity strongly
biassed him in favour of his wife&rsquo;s kinsmen, until his unhappy divorce
left him isolated.</p>

<p>Italy vied with Germany in the production of armour, Milan taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_14" id="b_Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the lead. Matthew of Paris heard, in 1237, from a credible Italian that
Milan and its dependencies could turn out 6000 men on iron-clad horses.
An item in the inventory of Louis Hutin, 1316, is &ldquo;2 haubergeons de
Lombardi&rdquo;; and that of Humphrey de Bohun, in 1322, mentions
Bologna &ldquo;un haubergeon qu&rsquo;est apele Bolioun.&rdquo; Italian armourers
were established in Paris as early as 1332. Ancient British ballads
abound in references to Myllan and Myllen steel. The Earl of Derby,
afterwards Henry IV., sent to procure armour from Sir Galeas, Duke of
Milan, and when he had selected all he wished for in plated and mail
armour, the Lord of Milan ordered four of the best armourers in Milan
to accompany the knight to England. In the fifteenth century Milan was
able, after the battle of Macado in 1427, to furnish within a few days 4000
suits of armour for cavalry and 2000 for infantry. At a great Spanish
tournament held in 1434, only Italian armour and weapons were permitted.
Louis XI. and the Duke of Burgundy settled Italian armourers
in their dominions. This king seized in 1481 a heavy convoy of
cuirasses, sallads, etc., packed in cotton to prevent them rattling and
imitating bales of silk, on the way to the Duke of Brittany, giving them
to John Doyac as a reward for their discovery. Monstrelet mentions that
the Milanese gave corselets and other armour to the Swiss, with the finest
promises, before the battle of Marignano. Henry VIII. kept 1000
Myllen swords for the tourney in the Tower, and sent to Milan to
purchase 5000 suits of &ldquo;almain rivets.&rdquo; The most eloquent testimony
to the excellence of Milanese arms is, however, to be found in the pages of
Brantôme, a very keen observer on all matters military. Milan furnished
the finest engraved and most elegant corselets for <i>hommes de pieds</i>
&ldquo;tant de M. de Strozzi que de Brissac.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ce genre de cuirasse
legère eut la plus grande vogue à la cour de France&rdquo;; and &ldquo;on y
approuvoit fort les corselets gravés de Milan et ne trouvoit point que nos
armoriers parvinssent à la mesme perfection, non plus qu&rsquo;aux morions.&rdquo;
Strozzi, insisting that his armaments should be Milanese, &ldquo;pria voire
quasy contraignit tous ses capitaines de n&rsquo;avoir plus autres armes, tant
harquebuses, fourniments, que corselets de Milan&rdquo;: while Guise wished
his infantry to be armed not with muskets, but good harquebuzes de
Milan&mdash;&ldquo;de bonne trampe pour ne crever.&rdquo; Milanese armourers, like
the Gambertis, were enticed to Paris; Pompée a Milanese was selected to<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_15" id="b_Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
teach the King fencing, and Maistre Gaspar de Milan is pronounced &ldquo;le
meilleur forgeur qui jamais eut.&rdquo; Brantôme further describes the troops
on their way to relieve Malta, &ldquo;portant sa belle harquebuze et son beau
fourniment de Milan,&rdquo; and adds, &ldquo;car nous avions passé par Milan, où
nous nous estions accommodez d&rsquo;habillements et d&rsquo;armes si superbement
qu&rsquo;on ne scavait pour quelz nous prendre, ou pour gentilshommes,
soldats, ou pour princes, tant nous foisoit beau veoir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Florence became later a great rival of Milan, and we find Wolsey
negotiating with a Florentine for &ldquo;2000 complete harness of Almayne
rivettes at 16s. per set.&rdquo; Brescia was famed for its steel, and probably
supplied the vast requirements of Venice, whose arsenals contained, in
the seventeenth century, arms for 800,000 combatants. Henry VIII.
requested permission from the Doge of Venice, in 1544, to purchase 1500
Brescian harquebuses, and over 1000 suits of horse and foot-armour.
Pisa, Lucca, Mantua, Verona, Pistoja also produced armour and weapons
of high quality.</p>

<p>Spain, with the most abundant and accessible supplies of the finest
iron ores in the world, celebrated for its weapons from the time of the
Punic wars, and with the immeasurable advantage of commanding the
services of the Moorish steel-workers who were masters of the armourer&rsquo;s
craft, ought to have maintained the first rank as armourers of the world.
It probably did for centuries supply its own requirements. We find
the Spanish warrior under James of Arragon, 1230, sheathed horse and
man in mail, with his quilted <i>perpunto</i> or pourpoint beneath, and the
iron <i>gonio</i> or breast-plate above; the iron greaves and shoes, helmet and
shield. Thus equipped, the Christian rode down the Moslem by superior
weight of man, horse, and arms, the Moors dispensing with pourpoint
and breast-plate, and riding unarmoured horses. The helmets were of
Zaragossa steel, and James&rsquo;s &ldquo;very good sword, lucky to those who
handled it,&rdquo; was from Monzon and called Tizo, as the more celebrated
sword of the Cid was called Tizona. The most dreaded weapon, however,
at this time, was the windlass cross-bow, whose bearers were
mounted and carried large shields.</p>

<p>Little of the Moorish armourer&rsquo;s work has come down, though they
worked steel extensively in Toledo and Seville. No Hispano-moresque
swords exist of earlier date than the fifteenth century, and these have<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_16" id="b_Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
richly-worked hilts in the Arab taste. A few Moorish helmets are
preserved, also of the fifteenth century, two of which, attributed to
Boabdil, are in the Madrid armoury, and are also richly decorated in the
Arab manner. The fame of Moorish armour is preserved in the words
Morion and Morris pike. The famed swords of Toledo did not obtain
renown until the Renaissance, and were not produced after the seventeenth
century. Real Spanish armour appears very clumsy, and probably
little, if any, was made much after the accession of Charles V. One of
the latest suits in the armoury at Madrid is late Gothic in feeling, with a
tilting helm of Henry VII., and marked with the poinçon of the city of
Valencia.</p>

<p>France is very much in the same position as England in regard to
armour, for no city in it ever established any permanent reputation as a
seat of manufacture. Louis X. had a Toulouse sword&mdash;Louis Hutin&rsquo;s
inventory comprises mail from Chambly. Metz, Pignerol, Abbeville are
mentioned by Brantôme as producing armour inferior to Italian.
Froissart speaks repeatedly of the excellence of Bordeaux weapons, but at
the time when Bordeaux was English. The same is true of the Limoges
steel. But Paris must after all have been the metropolis of French
armourers. The description by Froissart of the battle of Rosebecque,
fought in 1382, where the hammering on the helmets of the combatants
made a noise that could not have been exceeded if all the armourers of
Paris and Brussels had been there working at their trade, shows that these
cities were great centres for the production of armour. The names of
very few French armourers have escaped oblivion, however; and Italian
workmen were employed in France from at least the time of Louis XI.
Some beautifully decorated French armour exists, chiefly early seventeenth
century, but in France, as in England, most of the armour was
probably obtained from Italy and Germany, when once the superiority of
their work was definitely established.</p>

<p>Netherlandish armour was always in high repute, and some of the
Brussels armourers achieved European fame. It even set the fashion,
as we read that Sir Gilbert Talbot, 1353, provided himself with &ldquo;a curas
complete of Flanderis makyng of the new turn for £20.&rdquo; Very few
specimens that can be identified as Belgian or Flemish exist, however, in
collections.</p>

<h2><a name="b_II" id="b_II">II</a><br />
CHAIN MAIL</h2>


<p>The immense antiquity of chain mail, and that it originated in the East,
are the two facts beyond dispute in its history. Its fine-linked structure
exposes, however, the maximum surface of the perishable iron to atmospheric
decay, and hence few specimens of great antiquity are known.
The two shapeless masses of iron rust in the British Museum, brought from
Nineveh by Layard, only reveal on close examination that they were once
supple and glittering coats of mail. Whether these are to be assigned to
the Nineveh of Sennacherib or to the Sassanian period, they equally claim
to be the oldest actual relics of chain mail in existence. The jackets
sculptured on the Trajan column are unusually faithful and realistic
renderings of chain-mail armour, for the labour and difficulty of an exact
reproduction of the minute and complicated repetitions of form into
which the links of mail group themselves are generally evaded by a
variety of conventional ways of expressing its texture.</p>

<p>The wearers of mail were nomadic horse&mdash;Persian, Parthian, and
Scythian, and inhabited a belt stretching obliquely from the Caspian in
the direction of Scandinavia, the mysterious and imperfectly known
amber trade perhaps keeping these peoples in touch. The Viking became
acquainted with mail and brought a knowledge of it to Western Europe;
his descendants wore it in their expeditions to the East, completing the
circle when the mail-clad Crusaders under C&oelig;ur de Lion met the mail-clad
horse in alliance with the Saracens on the plains of Ascalon. Coats
of Eastern mail called gasigans, as told by Geoffrey de Vinsauf, formed
part of the spoils of victory taken by Richard, especially on the capture
of the great caravan near Galatin in 1192.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_18" id="b_Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Although an immense quantity of mail exists in collections at home
and abroad, it can as yet neither be dated nor located upon its intrinsic
structure. The links of the Viking suits discovered in the peat morasses
of Denmark are as carefully formed as those from Persia or India of the
present century. The fashion of the garment is the only guide, but
whether the mail is of the period of the garment, or older material made
up, cannot be determined. It continued to be used in the West until the
seventeenth century, and to a much later time in Eastern Europe; and
it is probable that no scrap of such a costly material was ever discarded.
It was not passed on and absorbed by foot soldiers, who seem rarely to
have cared to use it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;<i>Mail hauberk from Sinigaglia. Sir Noël Paton&rsquo;s Collection.</i></p></div>

<p>The Norman hauberk did not open down the front, but was drawn
over the head by the attendants just before the engagement commenced.
Wace relates that Duke William&rsquo;s mail was drawn on wrong side in front
in sight of the English. The Norman Duke is the only person represented
with leggings of mail in the Bayeux tapestry, and to the absence
of these Harold&rsquo;s death and the fate of the day were directly due. His
first wound was the turning-point of the battle, twenty Norman knights
breaking in and securing the standard. An armed man, says Wace,
struck him on the ventaille of the helmet and beat him to the ground,
and as he sought to recover himself a knight beat him down again, cutting
him on the thick of the thigh to the bone. Girth and Leofwine fell in
this onset. The manner of a death which sealed the fate of England
must have made a deep impression on the victors, and thenceforth
mail chausses became an essential part of the knight&rsquo;s equipment. That
any genuine specimens of either the sleeveless or the long-sleeved
hauberks of the eleventh or twelfth or even the thirteenth century have
been handed down, is improbable. Many mail suits, however, have been
acquired in the belief that they were European, and of great antiquity, to
the disappointment of their owners, like those adorning the Hall of the
Middle Temple, which are modern Persian. One of the oldest, perhaps,
is that said to have been found in making a road in Ph&oelig;nix Park in
1876, and alluded to in <i>Armour in England</i>. The oft-repeated statement
that it was found associated with a silver badge of the O&rsquo;Neills has been
ascertained by Mr. T. H. Longfield, F.S.A., to be baseless, the badge
having been purloined from the ancient harp in Trinity College, Dublin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_19" id="b_Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
on which it is now replaced. The hauberk, now in the writer&rsquo;s possession,
is of large size and reaches to the middle of the thighs, with short sleeves,
and is exquisitely made. Mail shirts, sleeves, etc., of later date than the
fourteenth century are far from uncommon, and are represented in every
collection. By the kindness of Sir Noël Paton a most perfect fourteenth
century specimen is illustrated. It is close fitting, and was exhibited in
1880, and described by Burgess as &ldquo;one of the few coats of mail which<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_20" id="b_Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
have any decided history.&rdquo; In Meyrick&rsquo;s <i>Critical Enquiry</i> we are told
that &ldquo;it had been purchased by a Jew from an ancient family at Sinigaglia,
near Bologna, in whose possession it had been beyond any of their
records.&rdquo; A note further informs us that &ldquo;the Jew bought it by the
ounce and paid for it forty guineas.&rdquo; Sir Samuel Meyrick observes that
it corresponds to the coat of mail on the statue of Bernabo Visconti at
Milan. It may be described as a single coat of mail with no slits and no
reinforcement. It measures 2 feet 9 inches from the top of the collar,
and has sleeves which are 10 inches long from the armpit. &ldquo;It is wider
at the bottom than at the waist, two gussets being inserted for this purpose.
The rings average a good half-inch in their interior diameter; half are
riveted and half are continuous, the latter have a pear-like section, the
rounded parts being on the inside circumference. The riveted rings
appear to have been made of circular wire, but have become rather
flattened, probably by wear. The rivets are of the pyramid shape, like
those of the Dublin coat of mail, but much bolder and larger. There is
a row of brass rings round the neck, and the bottom of the edge and
sleeves are finished by vandykes, also in brass rings, riveted with iron.
This is probably the finest coat of mail that has come down to us.&rdquo; One
of the figures guarding the Maximilian cenotaph wears a precisely similar
hauberk. Italian pictures in the National Gallery show that the custom of
finishing off mail defences with several rows of brass links, to form some
sort of scolloped edging, was universal in Italy during the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries. French and English monuments and manuscripts
prove that this custom extended to Western Europe, the
scolloped edge commonly showing over the tassets from beneath the
pourpoint.</p>

<p>Vestiges of the camail are found on fourteenth century bassinets just
as they are seen in the conical helmets from Nineveh and on the Trajan
column. The standing collar or gorget superseded it. <a href="#b_fig02">Fig. 2</a> reproduces
a perfect specimen belonging to the Royal Artillery Institution at
Woolwich, of exquisite work, with the links round the throat reinforced
or doubled. Though gorgets of plate were introduced as early as 1330,
many still preferred to wear the mail, so that they continued more or
less in use for two centuries longer. Mail was generally worn bright.
In the fourteenth century <i>Anturs of Arthur</i> we read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_21" id="b_Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His mayles were mylke quyte, enclawet full clene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His stede trappet with that ilke, as true men me told.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>An early fourteenth century stanza, the 39th of the &ldquo;Armynge of King
Arthur,&rdquo; suggests that the surcoat over mail was to keep off rain and
not sun. The colour green was almost universally used from the reign
of King John.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And werre it from the wette.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>For a brief period in the sixteenth century, mail was again worn
without plate armour. The custom was revived in Italy when assassination
was rife, and is seen in portraits of Italian noblemen in the National
Gallery.</p>

<p>The costume of the unfortunate Wyatt on his rebellion is described
in the chronicles of Jane and Queen Mary as &ldquo;a shert of mayll with
sleves, very fayre and thereon a velvet cassoke and an yellowe lace with
the windelesse of his dag hanging thereon, and a paire of botes and
spurres on his legges; on his hedd he had a faire hat of velvet with
broade bonne-work lace about it.&rdquo; Soon after a &ldquo;shippe laden with
shertes of mayll&rdquo; was brought in by Strangwyshe the Rover, &ldquo;who came
from the French king and submitted to the Queen&rsquo;s mercy.&rdquo; The<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_22" id="b_Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
celebrated duel between Jarnac and La Chateigneraye was fought in shirts
of mail.</p>

<p>In the Scottish wars of Edward I. it was a common saying that
&ldquo;arrows can penetrate the hardest mail&rdquo;; and more efficient armour
had to be devised. Simon de Montfort, standing like a tower and
wielding his sword with both hands, was pierced in the back by a foot
soldier who lifted up his mail. The hero died with &ldquo;Dieu merci&rdquo; on his
lips; not the only victim who met his death in this manner. The
change in the fashion of armour was hastened by such events. The
process has already been traced: it began at the knee-caps, which were
covered by plates called poleyns. Three actual and perfectly unique
specimens of these, belonging to Sir Noël Paton, show that they were
not laid upon or over the mail, but replaced it, as represented in monumental
effigies. One pair with parallel sides is finely embossed and
vandyked, closely resembling those of some early fourteenth century
effigies. A globose example formed of three articulated plates is still
more interesting, having been richly damascened with an arabesque design
worked in thin brass lines, the field being delicately and closely cross-hatched
with incised lines. The really remarkable and unexpected
surface decoration this discloses explains the nature, and confirms the
accuracy, of certain fourteenth century representations of black armour
covered with fine gold arabesques. The cross-hatching served to retain
the black pigment, and gave a dark cast to the steel surface, enhancing
the value of the delicate brass inlay.</p>

<p>The process of reinforcing the mail defence was continued, as we have
seen, until it was entirely cased with an outer shell of plate. A quilted
coat was worn beneath the mail, if not a second one between the mail and
plate armour. These multiplied defences must have made active fighting
difficult and most fatiguing, and were discarded so soon as a light armour
of fine steely quality, and without crevices, was procurable.</p>

<h2><a name="b_III" id="b_III">III</a><br />
GOTHIC ARMOUR</h2>


<p>Plate armour reached the perfection of workmanship in the second half of
the fifteenth century. At no period was it so light, yet impervious, with
curves and angles so admirably directed to deflect the impact of sword
or lance, and articulations so skilfully devised to mitigate the restraint
on freedom of movement necessarily imposed by a sheathing of steel.
Never was armour so closely fitted to the contour of the body, and thus
so elegant, so easily and therefore so constantly worn. This, the
so-called &ldquo;Gothic Armour,&rdquo; is the cynosure of collectors, and is so
rarely to be obtained that a fairly perfect cap-à-pie suit may command
some £2000.</p>

<p>This Gothic armour is the armour of the Van Eycks and Memling,
of Perugino and Leonardo, and of the earlier works of Albert Dürer.
The sumptuously illuminated French and English manuscripts of the
fifteenth century depict it in use in every vicissitude of war or combat,
by sea and land, on horse and foot, and testify how little it impeded the
freedom of action of the wearer. They show that it was rarely concealed
in campaigning by any textile garment, and also that when worn by
prince or noble, it might be gilded, entirely or partially, even almost
fantastically. Thus the upper half may be gilt, and the nether limbs left
burnished steel; or these gilt and the body steel; but more often the
alternate plates of the articulated breast and back defences, the arms, or
the elbow and knee pieces, are gilt, while the rest presents the normal
sheeny surface of steel.</p>

<p>The general characteristics of Gothic armour have been described in
<a href="#a_Page_1"><i>Armour in England</i></a>, illustrated in <a href="#a_fig19">Fig. 19</a>, by the fine and accurately<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_24" id="b_Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
modelled suit of the Beauchamp effigy at Warwick. Though many fine
suits have been brought to this country from abroad, none are in any way
connected with English wearers, and none could therefore be illustrated
in the former monograph. It seems incredible that nothing should have
been preserved either of the weapons or armour with which the long
struggle for supremacy in France was maintained during the minority
and rule of a king, too studious and placable for days when his turbulent
subjects cared only for war. Of the armour and weapons of the thousands
of men-at-arms who fell victims to the Wars of the Roses, the direct
outcome of the disappointing issue of the French Wars, and so annihilating
to English art, perhaps but a helmet and a few weapons remain.
The extermination of the old nobility; the completeness of the change
in habit and thought introduced into this country by the Renaissance,
affecting alike art, literature, and costume; the change in religion, the
revolution in the science of warfare, and the absolute centralisation of
the ambitious and luxurious nobility in the court or camp of Henry VIII.,
together with that vainglorious and wealthy despot&rsquo;s passion for extravagant
dress, novelty and pomp, combined to break most effectually with
the past and to render all Gothic armour mere obsolete lumber. Contemporary
pictures of Henry VIII.&rsquo;s proceedings, especially of his meeting
with Maximilian, in which the English retinue is equipped in the new
closed armet while Germans wear the old visored sallad, as well as the
accounts of his forces and his purchases of arms, convince us that out-of-date
armour and weapons, even if still serviceable, were no longer, as
heretofore, passed on to the lower ranks of retainers. Hall relates of
the muster of the city bands in the thirty-first year of Henry VIII. that
&ldquo;all were put aside who had Jackes, coates of plate, coates of mail, and
bryganders, and appointed none but such as had whyte harness, except
such as should bear the morish pykes, which had no harness but skulles.&rdquo;
The destruction of obsolete armour in this reign must have been very
complete, for no suits of the Gothic armour worn down to this date
by the fathers and grandfathers of the courtiers of Henry have been
preserved.</p>

Collection of the Duke of Westminster.</p></div>

<p>France and the Low Countries have been swept nearly as bare, anything
that might have been spared by former ages having been finally
destroyed when the houses of the nobility were gutted during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_25" id="b_Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Revolution. In more conservative Italy and Spain a few Gothic suits
have escaped destruction, and though the Art Renaissance of the one,
and wealth and pride of the other, were inimical to the preservation of
obsolete arms, yet probably some few specimens have passed from the
hands of private possessors into those of wealthy amateurs of France and
England. Germany, however, has ever been the inexhaustible treasure-house
whence Gothic arms and armour have leaked from the hands of
private possessors into those of collectors. In Germany even the trading
towns had clung to their ancient buildings, walls, and traditions, and in
many of the old Town Halls the furniture, arms, and weapons of the
civic guards, and the old implements of punishment and torture, are still
preserved. The innumerable feudal castles of the lesser nobility have to
a yet greater extent preserved the belongings of their ancient occupants,
who clung to their titles, heraldry, arms, and weapons as symbols of
vanishing rights and power, and of ancient pretensions and privileges, so
out of harmony with the world beyond. The ubiquitous and assiduous
dealer has long found in them a happy hunting-ground for arms and
weapons, whence to obtain the bulk of those he disposed of.</p>

<p>In addition, some important stores of Gothic armour have been disgorged
from the Levant, trophies of the incessant wars maintained by the
Turks against Christendom. A large quantity existed at Constantinople,
and the story goes that a ship, some fifty years ago, was actually freighted
to Genoa with old armour as ballast. The indefatigable dealer Pratt of
New Bond Street became possessed of some of this armour, which he
made up into suits in the best way he could, restoring but too liberally
the parts that were missing. The suit illustrated, <a href="#b_fig03">Fig. 3</a>, is in Lord
Zouche&rsquo;s collection at Parham, where it is catalogued as from the Church
of Irene at Constantinople: it no doubt formed part of this consignment.
The head-piece, an Italian sallad, is of later date, while the remainder,
though so beautiful in form, does not appear to be either entirely homogeneous
or complete. Other suits in Lord Zouche&rsquo;s extensive collection
are from the same source. Another much smaller series of Gothic armour
was brought to England from the Isle of Rhodes and most fortunately
did not pass through the hands of any dealer, and is thus in an absolutely
trustworthy condition, the very rust not having been removed.
It consists of a number of pieces, approximately of one date, many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_26" id="b_Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
particular elegance and interest, both on account of the armourer&rsquo;s marks,
and the examples of engraving they present.</p>

suits are illustrated. The first, Figs. 4 and 5, is German work of

<p>Sir Noël observes that &ldquo;the upper part of the suit especially is
remarkable for its perfect condition, the original straps being intact, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_28" id="b_Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the inner and outer surface of the metal having been scarcely touched by
rust.&rdquo; The graceful and doubly articulated and engrailed breast and
back-plates are beautifully designed, and finished in the manner of the
great master armourer Lorenz Colman of Augsburg. The curiously plain
collar is attached to the pectoral by a bolt and staple, and there is a fixed
lance-rest, these appliances adapting the suit for tilting rather than war.
There are no tuilles, one of the most persistent features of Gothic suits,
and no pauldrons or shoulder-guards. The brassards, coudières, genouillières,
formed of an unusual number of plates, and especially the
gauntlets, are of great beauty, and resemble those of Lorenz Colman&rsquo;s
suits. These and the <i>solerets à la poulaine retroussé</i>, to quote Sir Noël&rsquo;s
description, &ldquo;are exceptionally beautiful and artistic in design. Of the
sollerets, however, unfortunately only the left, with its fine, long-necked
spur silvered and thickly patinated, is genuine.&rdquo; &ldquo;The head-piece is a
strong bassinet of the type styled barbute by Viollet le Duc, and possibly
of somewhat earlier date, and bears on either side the armourer&rsquo;s mark.&rdquo;
The fine preservation of the metal &ldquo;is due no doubt to the fact that
the suit had remained for many generations in one place&mdash;an old mansion
in the northern Tyrol, whence so late as 1872 or 1873 it was obtained
by a well-known Parisian dealer, from whom it passed to Pratt of New
Bond Street; after whose death it came into my hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second of Sir Noël&rsquo;s suits (<a href="#b_fig06">Fig. 6</a>), of about the same date,
resembles more the armour of Italian pictures and actual Italian suits.
The articulated and channelled breast-plate is remarkably bold and graceful
in its lines, as are the entire brassards, more especially the coudières. &ldquo;The
spiked rondelles and the gauntlets have much picturesque character, and the
tuilles are exceptionally fine in form. The sollerets are of the kind called
<i>arc tiers point</i>. The head-piece is a close helmet of good design and apparently
contemporary.&rdquo; In general effect the armour is light but dignified:
though the breast-plate bears a Gothic R, no history attaches to it.</p>

<p>The great interest and beauty of the Parham suit, <a href="#b_fig03">Fig. 3</a>, lies in the
particularly elegant and finely laminated and engrailed breast and back-plates.
Like Sir Noël&rsquo;s German suit, it has no tuilles and retains the
staple for fastening the collar and the lance-rest. The sollerets and
perhaps some other pieces are restorations. It is without armourer&rsquo;s
marks, but resembles Nuremberg work in general form and detail.</p>

<p>For suits of Gothic armour which have belonged to known wearers, and
have been handed down with unbroken pedigree, we must go to the great
collections of Europe, and especially to those which, like the Viennese,
were commenced while armour was still worn. Of sculptured representations
of Gothic armour none surpass the Beauchamp effigy at Warwick.
A no less accurate figure is that by Peter Vischer, also in gilt bronze,
of Count Otto IV. of Henneburg, 1490, from the Church of Romhild in
Thuringia. There is a cast of this in the South Kensington Museum, as
well as one of the gilt bronze effigy of Count Weinsberg at Munich, in
armour which is remarkable in several respects. Italian Gothic armour of
different periods can best be studied in the National Gallery. A suit
(<a href="#b_fig07">Fig. 7</a>) of about the close of the century is from one of the compartments
of the famous altar-piece by Perugino, removed from the Certosa at
Pavia in 1786, and painted according to Vasari about 1490. It represents
St. Michael in full armour, except the head. The underlying mail shows,
as usual in Italian pictures, at the elbows, the skirt, and below the knees,
and has a deep edging of brass rings. The breast-plate, though in two, is
arranged so that the body could not easily be bent. The shoulder-guards
are less exaggerated than in contemporary French and English armour,
but the elbow-guards seem large, angular, and loosely fitting. The
sollerets are well made, unpointed, and leave the red stocking exposed at
the toe and heel. The sword, on the left hip, is in a velvet scabbard
with a beautifully and simply worked steel hilt and cross quillons slightly
curved towards the blade. The shield is fine in form and typically
Italian, bearing a Medusa&rsquo;s head and other classic ornaments, boldly
embossed. The hands are bare, the right holding a slender staff or wand.
In the figure of St. William by Ercole di Giulio Cesare Grandi of Ferrara,
the head is bare and there are no plate defences to the neck, shoulders, or
forearms. The top of the mail shirt shows as a narrow band round the
throat, and covers the shoulders with short and very wide-open sleeves, its
lower edge appearing between the tuilles over a second skirt of mail.
Mail appears again below the knees and forms the covering of the feet,
all edges being finished with rings of brass as usual. The breast-plate is<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_31" id="b_Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
large, plain, and of one piece; there are but three taces, with bold, finely
formed, and ridged tuilles. The brassards, including the large butterfly-shaped
coudière, appear from beneath the widely open sleeves of mail.
The leg armour is also plain, but with the wings of the genouillières exceptionally
large. The sword, unsheathed, is a magnificent weapon with gilt
or brass pommel and grip and horizontally curved quillons. The striking
figure of St. George by Pisano, in the broad-brimmed Tuscan hat, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_32" id="b_Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
of earlier date, as the artist died in 1451 or 1452. The mail shows
beneath a thick quilted surcoat over which the great ill-fitting shoulder
and other body defences are fixed. The limbs are almost completely
sheathed in plate over the mail, but the pieces fit so loosely that the
whole has a shambling appearance and seems ready to fall off. The
sollerets are square-toed with long rowelled spurs. The armour
represented in Boccacino&rsquo;s Procession to Calvary is almost identical, save
that the mail sleeves are less baggy and shoulder pieces are worn. The
St. William in Garofalo&rsquo;s Madonna and Child from Ferrara, though
probably painted in the 16th century, preserves the exaggerated butterfly
wings to the coudières and genouillières, and the Gothic tuilles, but has
fluted sollerets and shows no mail. The St. Demetrius of L&rsquo;Ortolano, who
painted in the first quarter of the sixteenth century, shows fluted shoulder
pieces and coudières, and half sollerets, leaving the front of the foot to a
defence of mail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span>&mdash;<i>The Battle of Sant&rsquo; Egidio. By Uccello. National Gallery.</i></p></div>

<p>The most interesting picture in the National Gallery (<a href="#b_fig08">Fig. 8</a>) to the
student of armour, however, is that representing the battle of Sant&rsquo; Egidio
by Uccello, fought in 1416, when Carlo Malatesta, Lord of Rimini, and
his nephew Galeazzo, were taken prisoners by Braccio di Montone.
Uccello was born in 1397 and died in 1475, but there is no evidence as to
the year in which the picture was painted. It appears to represent an
attempt to rescue the Lord of Rimini, by a knight clothed cap-à-pie in very
advanced plate armour and wielding a horseman&rsquo;s hammer. The breast
and back plates are articulated; tuilles, where worn, are very short; the
large pauldrons are of very varied construction, and either roundels or
coudières with butterfly expansions are worn indifferently; in all cases
the figures are completely cased in plate armour, though some wear mail
gorgets, except that Malatesta has been partly disarmed and is protected
by mail alone. De Commines observes that it was the law of arms in
Italy to strip those taken to their shirts and dismiss them. The chief
interest lies in the head-pieces, which, except in the cases of the prisoners
and some trumpeters, are closed armets with baviers and visors hinged
at the side, of varied form, the occularia being in all cases notched out
at the upper margin of the visor and forming either round or half-round
holes or slits. These armets are provided with most fantastic crests
and plumes, the crown of the helmet being in several cases covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_33" id="b_Page_33">[Pg 33]</a><br /><a name="b_Page_34" id="b_Page_34">[Pg 34]</a><br /><a name="b_Page_35" id="b_Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
velvet, overlaid with goldsmith&rsquo;s work and merging into the crest. All
have the roundels at the back of the neck.</p>

<p>Another notable representation of an Italian battle (<a href="#b_fig09">Fig. 9</a>), in which
the mounted combatants are clothed in complete typical Gothic armour, is
to be seen in the cast from the Visconti Tomb of the Certosa, Pavia, in
the South Kensington Museum. The armour is of the most beautiful
type, and the figures are singularly supple and full of action. The armet
is more fully developed and almost uniform in type. The visor works on<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_36" id="b_Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
pivots, the occularium is a slit above it, and the bavier is a separate piece
fastened by straps at the back. The event represented is the battle before
Brescia in 1402. As a full-sized representation of the latest Italian Gothic
armour nothing can perhaps be finer than the fifteenth century effigy of
Guidarello Guidarelli surnamed Braccioforte from Ravenna, of which there
is also a cast in the South Kensington Museum. The tuilles are flexible
and pointed, formed of narrow horizontal plates; the shoulder-plates are
bossed into lions&rsquo; heads; and the armet has a double visor without bavier.</p>

<p>The statue of St. George, made by Donatello for the Florentine corporation
of armourers in 1416, is almost Roman in costume and of little
interest.</p>

<p>The account of the almost contemporary battle of Fornovo, 1495, by
Philip de Commines bears testimony to the excellence of this Italian
armour, especially of the close armets. The flower of the allied forces of
Italy consisted of 2500 men-at-arms under the Marquis of Mantua,
Count di Cajazzo, and Signor John Bentivoglio of Bologna, with other
nobles, all well barded, with fine plumes of feathers and bourdonasses,
or hollow lances, brightly painted, and used in tournaments. Great
bodies of men-at-arms were in reserve. The French van contained 350
men-at-arms, 200 mounted crossbow-men of the king&rsquo;s guard&mdash;who
fought on foot, however&mdash;300 archers and 3000 Swiss foot, several of the
highest nobility dismounting to fight amongst them. In the main body
were the king&rsquo;s guards, pensioners, 100 Scottish archers, about 900
men-at-arms, and 2500 Swiss, the whole army not exceeding 9000 men.
The Italian men-at-arms delivered a charge, with lances couched, at a
gentle gallop; the Estradiots, who should have supported them with
their scimitars, retired to plunder the sumpter-horses; whereupon the
men-at-arms who had charged and broken their lances fled, and their
infantry gave ground. Those who had not charged also threw away
their lances and fled, sword in hand, and were pursued and cut up.
With the French were &ldquo;a great number of grooms and servants, who
flocked about the Italian men-at-arms, when they were dismounted,
and knocked most of them on the head. The greatest part of them
had their hatchets (which they cut their wood with) in their hands, and
with them they broke up their head-pieces, and then knocked out their
brains, otherwise they could not easily have killed them, they were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_37" id="b_Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
very well armed; and to be sure there were three or four of our men
to attack one man-at-arms. The long swords also which our archers
and servants wore did very good execution.&rdquo; The losses on the French
side were but three gentlemen, nine Scottish archers, twenty horse of the
vanguard, and some servants. The Italians lost 3500 men on the field,
of whom 350 were men-at-arms, including six or eight of the Marquis
of Mantua&rsquo;s relatives and other persons of quality. The lances &ldquo;lay
very thick upon the field, and especially the bourdonasses; but they
were good for nothing, for they were hollow and light, and weighed no
more than a javelin, yet they were finely painted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Battles in England were much more serious affairs and were stubbornly
contested. Those of the Wars of the Roses opened with a cannonade,
after which the archers engaged and the billmen followed, nobles fighting
on foot in their ranks to encourage them. Lord Richard Herbert
&ldquo;twice by fine force passed through the battaill of his adversaries,&rdquo; at
Banbury, &ldquo;polle axe in hand&rdquo;: at the battle of Towcester many were
taken because they left their horses and decided to fight on foot. The
Earl of Warwick dismounted at Barnet to &ldquo;try the extremity of hand
strokes&rdquo;; but penetrating too far among the enemy to encourage his men,
and not being properly supported, he was slain.</p>

<p>At Bosworth the archers formed the forward on both sides. Richard&rsquo;s
archers &ldquo;with a sodein clamour lette arrowes flee at theim. On the other
syde they paied theim home manfully again with the same. But when
they came nere together, they laied on valeauntly with swordes.&rdquo; The
Earl of Oxford, however, kept his men in close order, and the enemy gave
way, wholesale desertion sealing the fate of the battle. Henry was not
engaged, but kept afar off &ldquo;with a fewe companye of armed menne.&rdquo;
Richard on horseback made a desperate attempt to get at him, but was
unsupported and slain.</p>

<p>The English costume is described in the Plumpton Correspondence,
when the Archbishop of York, having dues to collect in 1441, quartered
200 men-at-arms in Ripon and held it &ldquo;like a towne of warre.&rdquo; These
borderers wore &ldquo;breast-plate, vambrace, rerebrace, greves and guischers,
gorgett and salett, long spears and lancegayes.&rdquo; English levies were
not always so well armed. The 5000 men who came down from the
north in the reign of Richard III. were &ldquo;evell apparelled and worsse<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_38" id="b_Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
harneysed in rustic harneys.&rdquo; Under Henry VII. the Duke of Bedford
took out &ldquo;3000 mene which were harneysed but barely, for theyr breste
plates were for the most parte lether.&rdquo; The array taken to Calais by
Edward IV. in 1475 is in striking contrast to this. Hall relates that
&ldquo;the men were so well armed and so surely in all things appoynted and
provided that the Frenche naciõ were not onely amased to behold them,
but much more praysed them and there order. In this army were 1500
men of armes well horsed, of the which the moste parte were barded and
rychely trapped, after the most galiard fashion, havyng many horses
decked in one suyte. There were farther 15,000 archers beryng
bowes and arrowes, of the which a greate parte were on horsebacke.
There were also a great number of fighting men and others, as
well to set up Tentes and Pavillions, as to serve their Artilarie.&rdquo;
De Commines adds that the men-at-arms, comprising the flower of
the English nobility, were richly accoutred after the French fashion,
well mounted, most of them barded, and each one with several persons
in his retinue.</p>

<p>This Gothic armour, the lightest and most graceful ever produced,
was ideal so long as it was customary for men-at-arms to fight indifferently
on foot or mounted. The mixed tourney was still in vogue, fought the
first day with sharp spears, the second day with swords, the third on foot
with poll-axes. The Lord Scales and the Bastard of Burgundy, and the
Duke of Albany and Duke of Orleans fought such tourneys, the latter
having the misfortune to kill his antagonist by a spear-thrust. It was,
in battle too, most honourable to fight on foot among the archers, and
there was always a large number of gentlemen volunteering among them
to &ldquo;encourage the infantry&rdquo; and make them fight the better. &ldquo;The
Burgundians had learnt this custom from the English when Duke Philip
made war upon France during his youth for two-and-thirty years together
without any truce.&rdquo; De Commines adds that at Montlhéry the order
was given to the Burgundians that every man should alight without any
exception. Knights equipped by the most renowned of the armourers
of Italy and Germany were almost invulnerable until overthrown; but
English and Burgundian armour was not an equal protection, as the rash
Duke of Burgundy, who seems to have had all his armour home-made at
Dijon or Hesdin, discovered to his cost on the field of Nancy, when his<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_39" id="b_Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
skull was cloven by a halberd, and two pike-thrusts penetrated the lower
part of his body.</p>

<p>This fashion of armour appears to have been devised in the ateliers
of the Missaglias of Milan. A work by Wendelin Böheim, custodian
of the Imperial collections of armour in Vienna, published last year
in Berlin (<i>Meister der Waffenschmiedekunst vom xiv bis im xviii Jahrhundert</i>),
gives a short biographical sketch of this renowned family of
armourers, who migrated to Milan towards the middle of the fourteenth
century, from Ello, a village not distant from Asti and Lake Lecco.
Petrajolo da Missaglia, the founder of the family, settled in Milan as an
armourer towards the middle of the fourteenth century, and built the
house in the Via degli Spadari where his sculptured poinçon or armourer&rsquo;s
mark is still to be seen. The work of his son Tomaso da Missaglia
greatly augmented the already world-wide reputation of the armour of
Milan, and deserved in 1435 the recognition of Filipo Maria Visconti, who
freed him in 1450 from taxes until his death somewhere about 1469.
The armour by him is plain, the best known being that at Vienna of
the Palsgrave Frederick the Victorious about 1450, with closed helm,
roundels, unfingered gauntlets, and pointed sollerets over 13 inches in
length. The suit is less graceful than German Gothic armour. The
equally renowned son of Tomaso, Antonio, was born about 1430, assisting
in his father&rsquo;s extensive business at the age of twenty. Large commissions
were received, such as that in 1466, of the value of 20,000 lire, for 100
harness for the ducal mercenaries, and others from Duke Francesco, the
Pope, Don Alfonso of Arragon, afterwards King of Naples, etc. On his
father&rsquo;s death in 1469, their great patron the Duke presented him with
an estate and mill, and in 1470 he added the iron mines near Canzo to
his patrimony. Soon after, in 1492, a Venetian envoy sent home an
account of Missaglia&rsquo;s works, finding finished harness to the value of
many thousand ducats. His death took place near the end of the
century; the exact date being unknown, like the name of his immediate
successor. There are mentions of several Missaglias about whom little is
known, one working in 1466 for Louis XI. Antonio was the last to
bear the name of Missaglia, succeeding members of the family assuming
that of Negroli, a name first met with about 1515, when a Giovanni
Negroli appears as master of the works. The tomb in St. Satyro, Milan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_40" id="b_Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
preserves the inscription <i>Negroli da Ello qualunque detto Missaglia</i>.
Few examples of Antonio&rsquo;s work are known. One of these, a plain
suit made for the Neapolitan Count Cajazzo about 1480, is in the
Vienna Imperial collections. The breast and back plates are not articulated,
the pauldrons and tuilles are large and massive, coudières elegant,
only the right gauntlet fingered, the leg-pieces with few articulations, and
the suit, as so often seen in illustrations, is minus the sollerets. The
head-piece is a sallad singularly painted in oils with the Count&rsquo;s armorial
bearings, reminding us of the beautifully painted armour of Pisano&rsquo;s St.
George published by the Arundel Society, which must have been executed
prior to 1450. A jousting suit by him of much later date is engraved
and partly gilded, apparently made in 1498 for an envoy of Ludovico
Moro to the Emperor Maximilian.</p>

<p>Italian Gothic armour is very much rarer than German. Thoroughness
is a German characteristic, and once embarked on a given course the
German pursues it until, as is so apparent in their general iron-work, the
result becomes exaggeration verging on the grotesque. The Missaglias
introduced a certain grace of line into Milanese armour, and the German
armourers pursued this vein, making the figures erect and slender and imbuing
the waist and bust with womanly elegance. The Italians probably
kept to much the same lines, for most representations of armour towards
the third quarter of the fifteenth century display the same graceful characteristics,
brought to a pitch, however, but little consonant with the stern
realities of war, and brusquely set aside before the close of this century.</p>

<p>One of the most formidable of Missaglia&rsquo;s competitors north of the
Alps was Hans Grünewalt, born about 1440 and died 1503, regarded by
Böheim as one of the foremost armourers of his day. The founder of the
bells of St. Sebaldus in 1396, Heinrich Grünewalt, appears to have been
the grandfather of a family which became considerable in Nuremberg,
building the still standing Pilatus House, properly the &ldquo;Zum geharnischten
Mann.&rdquo; Hans was employed by Maximilian when King of the Romans,
and no armourer in Germany was more sought after. While he flourished
Nuremberg was the most renowned of any city of Germany for the
production of armour, but on his death Augsburg was allowed to entirely
supplant it.</p>

<p>The Colman family migrated from Bâle to Augsburg about 1377,<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_41" id="b_Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
to again quote from Böheim. Georg, the father of Lorenz, was well
established as an armourer when he was joined in 1467 by his famous
son. In 1477 they were honoured with a commission from Maximilian,
then King of the Romans, for a complete harness for horse and man, which
was executed to his entire satisfaction. Georg died two years later. In
1490 Lorenz was appointed Court Armourer, and he had prospered so far
as to be able to afford pecuniary assistance to the ever-needy Maximilian.
Towards 1506 he worked for the Court of Mantua, receiving through
the house of Fugger a payment of no less than 4000 florins for a harness
which gave such satisfaction that a further sum was sent him as a present.
In 1507 Maximilian again employed him, and in 1508 begged him to
repair personally to Court, when probably the important change in the
fashion of armour, resulting in the Maximilian fluted armour, was devised
personally between Lorenz and himself. The first edition of Hans
Burgkmair&rsquo;s woodcut engraving of the Emperor in a full suit of this
armour for horse and man appeared in this same year. Lorenz died in
1516. The only authentic suits by him known to Böheim are in the
Imperial collections of Vienna. One is the magnificent Gothic suit
made in 1493 for Maximilian, a far more complete and defensive suit
than those we have figured, but with similar fleur-de-lis pattern engrailing
to the margins of the plates, while some of the upper edges on the limb
pieces are rolled over and finished with a cable border. The suit is
graceful and of exquisite workmanship, slightly fluted in the arms, with
fingered gauntlets and moderately long and pointed sollerets. Three other
tilting suits bear the Colman mark, the close-helmet surmounted by a
cross, with the Augsburg badge and guild mark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>&mdash;<i>German late Gothic Suit. Collection of Mr. Morgan Williams.</i></p></div>

<p>The Germans, however, as a race were not all lithe and supple men,
and the burly high-living barons could not follow, and hence must have
detested the elegancies of Gothic armour. They soon affected an opposite
extreme, the clumsy sturdiness seen in so many of the portrait statues of
the contemporaries of Maximilian round his cenotaph in Innsbrück.
<a href="#b_fig10">Fig. 10</a> represents a complete and characteristic suit of this kind belonging
to Mr. Morgan Williams. It greatly resembles one figured by Böheim,
made for Count Andreas von Sonnenberg about 1508, by Koloman Colman,
and now in Vienna. Our suit, preserved in a Rhenish Castle, bears evidence,
however, of being considerably earlier, and is regarded by its owner<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_42" id="b_Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
as of about 1495. It is perfectly plain except for some slight fluting on
the mittened gauntlets, made to look as if fingered, and on the square-toed
sollerets. The tuilles are still an important feature, but wide and plain.
Some German suits of this date look affectedly ungainly; such as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_43" id="b_Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
mounted suit attributed to Duke John of Saxony, which is slightly fluted
and bears the great tilting helm.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;<i>Suit of Maximilian Fluted Armour.
Belonging to Mr. Percy Macquoid.</i></p></div>

<p>The Maximilian fluted armour is a development of this, belonging,
however, rather to Renaissance than Gothic times. With its introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_44" id="b_Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the elegance so distinctive of late Gothic armour passed definitely out of
fashion and gave place to armour in which the opposite characteristics
were sought. The flutings which invest the Maximilian suits with so
much character must have been suggested more or less by the shell-like
ridgings and flutes of Gothic armour. The leading idea was the substitution
of a stiff unyielding defence for one that was supple and pliable.
The articulations of the breast and back plates&mdash;except in rare instances,
such as the magnificent Nuremberg suit formerly worn by Lord Stafford, in
which the breast-plate was formed of two pieces and decorated with graceful
open-work tracery&mdash;were wholly abolished, and replaced by a stout and
rigid pectoral more adapted to receive the shock of the lance in the tilt-yard.
The form of tourney had changed, and was now chiefly tilting with
a light and hollow lance, calculated to shiver at the impact, as may be
seen in specimens still preserved in the Tower. The pliable Gothic
suits adapted for mixed tourneys and for actual warfare were out of
place in the tilt as now practised; and the heavy man-at-arms in full
cap-à-pie armour had ceased to play the preponderating part in war and
was shortly destined to disappear from the field. No longer was his
function, as hitherto, to engage in the melée, and bear the brunt of the
battle: this was sustained by the pike, arquebus, light-armed cavalry and
artillery; the heavy-armed cavalry being reserved for charges in which
the weight of man and horse sheathed in steel might ride down the
opposing force.</p>

<p>All the cap-à-pie suits of fluted Maximilian armour resemble each
other in their more salient characteristics. They are extremely defensive
and well made, with every piece more or less fluted, except the greaves,
which are usually perfectly plain. Many of the pieces have turned-over
edges worked into cable patterns. The pauldrons and coudières are well
developed, the gauntlets mittened, sollerets with very broad and square
toes, breast-plate generally globose, but sometimes brought to a blunt
point, often with a roundel guarding the left arm-pit. The armet has
usually a low central cabled comb with parallel flutes on either side,
occasionally there are three or five combs. The visor is usually thrown
into three or four horizontal peaks or ridges, often with the underhung
look believed to have been introduced in compliment to the House of
Hapsburgh. An almost equally common form is the puffed visor, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_45" id="b_Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the form of the head-piece is generally more varied than that of the rest
of the suit. The fine Nuremberg suit, <a href="#b_fig11">Fig. 11</a>, owned by Mr. Percy
Macquoid, shows the bellows visor and the rope crest, and in it all the
leading characteristics of Maximilian armour are well displayed, especially
the duck-bill sollerets, the flutings of which boldly finish in ram&rsquo;s horns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_46" id="b_Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
The suit formerly belonged to the King of Prussia, and seems to be
perfect, except the collar, an apparent restoration.</p>

<p>Maximilian armour is greatly favoured by collectors. There are
cap-à-pie and barded suits in the Tower and the Wallace collections, at
Warwick, and in the collections of Mr. Panmure Gordon and Sir
Wheatman Pearson. The horse armour, which nearly entirely sheathes
the head, neck, and fore- and hind-quarters, is fluted, gracefully curved,
and except the crinière, worked in large pieces, the lower margins curving
well away from the flanks. Three-quarter and half suits are well represented
in the Tower and the Wallace collections, the one figured, <a href="#b_fig12">Fig. 12</a>,
being a finely typical example brought from Strawberry Hill, and now<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_47" id="b_Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the property of the Duke of Westminster. This armour seems to have
been at times partly gilded, and instances exist where small badges are
repeated to form bands of raised work between the flutes. It is sometimes
engraved with borders of floral design, either edging the different
pieces, or more boldly treated as in <a href="#b_fig13">Fig. 13</a> from the Burges Collection in
the British Museum. Though mainly worn in Germany, fluted armour
became everywhere the fashion, the portrait by Piero di Cosimo, <a href="#b_fig14">Fig. 14</a>, in
the National Gallery affording an admirable representation of a breast-plate
with delicate flutes on the lower half. An actual specimen resembling this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_48" id="b_Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
but engraved, is in the collection from Rhodes at Woolwich. The
corselets furnished to the Swiss pike-men by the Milanese appear also to
have been of this pattern. Besides the bellows visor, and one puffed
out to give breathing space and fluted, the visor was at times embossed
into the form of a grotesque face with mustachios. Sometimes the
helmets in which this occurs had a pair of fan-like appendages in pierced
and fluted steel, forming a dignified and wing-like crest. The remarkable
example in the Tower, <a href="#b_fig15">Fig. 15</a>, once silvered, and presented by
Maximilian himself to Henry VIII., has a pair of ram&rsquo;s horns instead
of wings. It has since been painted and rendered more absurd by
spectacles, and assigned without any reason to the King&rsquo;s jester, Will
Somers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span>&mdash;<i>Helmet. Presented by Maximilian to Henry VIII. Tower of London.</i></p></div>

<p>These grotesque helmets were sometimes worn with armour puffed
and slashed to imitate civilian dress. A few pieces of this kind are in
the Tower, but the Wallace Collection possesses a three-quarter suit,
slashed, puffed, engraved, and gilt, the armet having the bellows visor
and five-roped comb. The extreme of exaggeration to which German
armourers were carried is seen in the suit in the Ambras Collection,
figured by Hefner and by Hewett, in which the cloth bases as well as
the puffed sleeves of the civilian are carefully imitated in steel. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_49" id="b_Page_49">[Pg 49]</a><br /><a name="b_Page_50" id="b_Page_50">[Pg 50]</a><br /><a name="b_Page_51" id="b_Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
visor is singularly grotesque, and the whole presents a ludicrous and
ungainly appearance, as well as being quite unserviceable.</p>

<p>The cap-à-pie suit of Henry VIII., <a href="#b_fig16">Fig. 16</a>, belongs to this group, and
though not fluted, is made like the Maximilian armour, the high erect
shoulder-piece and large coudières giving it a striking character. The
armet is of fine form, with the visor thrown into the series of peaks and
ridges common to fluted armour, and known to collectors as the bellows
shape. The bridle-hand wears the mainfere (main-de-fer), while the
right hand grasping the spear is gauntleted. The horse armour, though
so boldly embossed, is of earlier date, not later than Henry VII. The
foliated scrolls surround the <i>cross ragulé</i> and steel brickets and fire-stones,
so that it probably presents a rare specimen of the Burgundian armourer&rsquo;s
craft.</p>

<p>The head-piece for tilting used in Germany and England during the
reign of Henry VII. and first years of Henry VIII., and known a century
earlier, is represented, <a href="#b_fig17">Fig. 17</a>, by the remarkably perfect specimen found
in the triforium of Westminster Abbey in 1869. It weighs 17&frac12; lbs.,
the few others known in England weighing, with one exception, considerably
over 20 lbs. When fixed, the helm itself was immovable, but
as there were quite three inches of space round the head, movement inside
was possible. The occularium is placed so that the head must be lowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_52" id="b_Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
to see out, the combatants sighting each other like bulls before making
their rush, and throwing up the head to escape splinters of the lance.</p>

<p>The abandonment of this heavy helm for a much lighter form may
have been due to Henry VIII. himself. Hall narrates that tilting on one
occasion in 1524, with his great friend and brother-in-law Brandon,
Duke of Suffolk, he had on a helmet of a new fashion, devised by himself,
the like of which had not before been seen. It had a visor, which
was up and unfastened, leaving the king&rsquo;s face exposed, when by some
mischance the word was given to Brandon to start. No doubt in the old
helm, and remarking that he could not see, he couched his lance, striking
the king on the brow of the skull-piece or main portion of his helmet.
Appalled at the narrow escape, he vowed he would never tilt with his
sovereign more. One of the lighter forms of tilting helmet, <a href="#b_fig18">Fig. 18</a>,
from Penshurst, shows the small trap-door for speaking or breathing, but
now riveted down. A second helmet, <a href="#b_fig19">Fig. 19</a>, of rather later date, is
surmounted by the porcupine crest in wood, removed in the illustration,
and is interesting as having belonged to the grandfather of Sir Philip
Sidney. Both these helmets perhaps hung in Penshurst Church.</p>

<p>The sallad, the head-piece <i>par excellence</i> of Gothic armour, continued
in use, especially in Germany, until far into the sixteenth century. In
its simplest form it was the archer&rsquo;s head-piece: but provided with slits
for vision, pulled over the brow in time of danger to meet the chin
defence or bavier, it became almost a closed helmet; and with the further<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_53" id="b_Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
addition of a visor and other reinforcing pieces, it was used for battle or
tilting by the mounted knight. It was never a very safe head-piece, De
Commines relating how the Count of Charolois received a sword-wound
on the neck at Montlhéry, 1465, for want of his bavier, &ldquo;which, being
slightly fastened in the morning, dropped from his head in the battle&mdash;I
myself saw it fall.&rdquo; The Venetian form survived during the
seventeenth century, though for pageantry rather than use, being covered
with red velvet richly ornamented with beaten iron foliage and scrolls,
gilded and sometimes surmounted by a swan-like crest. The richness of
decoration of the sallad has been alluded to in the former monograph.
The battle picture by Paolo Uccello, <a href="#b_fig08">Fig. 8</a>, shows one covered with red
velvet and studded with nails. Elizabeth with her own hands garnished
the sallad of Henry VII. with jewels, and in 1513 Erasmus Kirkener
received £462:4:2 for &ldquo;garnishing a salet&rdquo; and a head-piece, &ldquo;and
mending a shapewe.&rdquo; Pope Pius V. sent Alva a sallad and sword for his
brave fights for the Church. Wooden shields covered with painted canvas,
embossed leather, or gesso, continued in use in Germany down to about
the end of the reign of Maximilian. The magnificent specimen, <a href="#b_plate_1">Plate I.</a>,
is now in the British Museum. Of late fifteenth century date, it is of
wood lined with leather, faced with canvas, over which a layer of gesso has
been laid to receive the gilding. Upon the gold ground the design has
been painted, a knight in Gothic armour, with armet and poll-axe on the
ground before him, kneeling to a lady, with the appropriate legend <i>Vous
ou la mort</i>. The surfaces are finely curved. In the Tower inventory,
quoted by Lord Dillon, among the jewels is a target of the Passion with
Our Lady and St. George.</p>

<p>The splendid decoration of the sword-hilts used with Gothic armour
has already been noticed. By the kindness of Sir Noël Paton an exquisite
specimen in the finest preservation is illustrated in <a href="#b_fig20">Fig. 20</a>. The
pommel and cross-hilt are plated with silver gilt, and the former bears
a shield with the arms of Battle Abbey and the initials T. L. of Abbot
Thomas de Lodelowe, 1417-1434. It came into the possession of Sir
John Gage, K.G., on the suppression of the monasteries, his descendant
presenting it to the Meyrick Collection. Few existing swords, except
those used as municipal insignia, are in equal preservation, but richly
worked hilts are represented in brasses and monuments. Swords<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_54" id="b_Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
abounded in churches, but few are left besides the royal swords at
Westminster, Canterbury, and Windsor. Part of the glamour surrounding
Joan of Arc was due to the consecrated sword taken by her from St.
Catherine&rsquo;s Church at Tours. The sword of Guy, Earl of Warwick, was
specially mentioned in a will of the time of Henry IV., and its custody
confirmed to the family after the accession of Henry VIII. It is curious
to note that in 1319 the wearing of swords in London was forbidden, and
those confiscated were hung up beneath Ludgate, within and without.</p>

<p>The interesting sword, <a href="#b_fig21">Fig. 21</a>, from Her Majesty&rsquo;s collection at

growing out of one of the quillons, the first step, as Baron de
Cosson remarks, &ldquo;towards the evolution of the beautiful and complicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_55" id="b_Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>

fully gilt, the grip of wood.&rdquo; The blade is gilt and engraved for a few
inches where it shows dark in the illustration, and is inscribed with the
name of the Cid Marchio Rodericus Bivar and a shield of arms, these
having been added, in the Baron&rsquo;s opinion, in the sixteenth or seventeenth
century. Only four swords with the little semicircular guard or &ldquo;half
pas d&rsquo;ane&rdquo; were known when he described them, being introduced owing
to the Italian custom of bending the forefinger round the quillon when
slashing.</p>

<h2><a name="b_IV" id="b_IV">IV</a><br />
ENRICHED ARMOUR</h2>


<p>Armour was enriched in almost all ages, sometimes ostentatiously so, and
at other times left affectedly plain. It was, however, only when wearing
it in battle ceased to be a paramount necessity, that armour definitely
became little more than a mere vehicle for lavish display. Lightly
armed and easily man&oelig;uvred troops and artillery were steadily becoming
increasingly important factors in deciding the fortunes of battle, and
at last men could with difficulty be brought to undergo the fatigue of
carrying weighty armour which they regarded as no efficient protection.
Sir James Smith&rsquo;s complaint in 1530 puts the matter clearly: &ldquo;But that
which is more strange, these our new fantasied men of warre doo despise
and scorne our auncient arming of ourselves, both on horseback and on
foot, saying that wee armed ourselves in times past with too much armour, or
peeces of yron (as they terme it). And therefore their footmen piqueurs
they do allow for very well armed when they weare their burgonets, their
collars, their cuirasses, and their backs, without either pouldrons, vambraces,
gauntlets, or tasses.&rdquo; This arming is even lighter than Mr.
J. F. Sullivan&rsquo;s picturesque Marauder of Picardie (<a href="#b_plate_2">Plate II.</a>). The Battle
of the Spurs perhaps did much to break the prestige of men-at-arms, who
were routed by one-tenth their number of English horse. The French
chivalry, armed cap-à-pie, came on in three ranks thirty-six deep, and were
targets as usual for the English archers, who lined a hedge, &ldquo;and shotte
apace and galled the French horse.&rdquo; The English horse, and a few
mounted archers who had gone forward with spears, &ldquo;set on freshly crying
St. George,&rdquo; whereupon the French fled, throwing away &ldquo;speres, swordes,
and mases,&rdquo; and cutting the bards of their horses. The Estradiots<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_57" id="b_Page_57">[Pg 57]</a><br /><a name="b_Page_58" id="b_Page_58">[Pg 58]</a><br /><a name="b_Page_59" id="b_Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
coming down in front of the French host caught sight of the English
horse, and mistaking the king&rsquo;s battaille of foot for horse also, turned
and fled, chased by the Burgundians and Walloons; the main body
of English, on foot with the king, having no opportunity of engaging.</p>

<div class="center">

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span>&mdash;<i>German Armour. Date about 1570. The Duke of Westminster, K.G.</i></p></div>

<p>The large proportion of mercenaries retained on either side contributed
more perhaps than anything else to the disuse of armour. Nicander Nucius
relates that in Henry VII.&rsquo;s expedition to Scotland there were &ldquo;Italians
in no small number, and of Spaniards, and also moreover of Argives
from Peloponnesus.&rdquo; In 1546 Lord Grey de Wilton brought his
&ldquo;Bullenoyes and Italian harquebuziers&rdquo; from Boulogne. In invading
Scotland two years later he divided &ldquo;his menne of armes, demilaunces,
and light horsemenne into troops, appointing the Spanish and Italian
hagbutters on horsebacke to keepe on a wing.&rdquo; Captain Gambo, a
Spaniard, and others held command, and, &ldquo;being backed by the Almayne
footmen, entered againe into Scotland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In proceeding to quell the insurrection in Devonshire, Lord Grey&rsquo;s
forces included, among other strangers, a band of horsemen &ldquo;most part
Albanoyses and Italians,&rdquo; and a band of Italian footmen under Captain
Paule Baptist Spinola of Genoa. These mercenaries armed themselves
in their own fashion and were not to be controlled. Nor does it appear
that the Tudor kings were anxious to put even their body-guards in
anything like complete armour. Henry VII.&rsquo;s guard consisted &ldquo;of fifty
yeomen, tall personable men, good archers, and divers others.&rdquo; A little
later, on the marriage of Prince Arthur, the guard consisted of 300 carrying
halberts, in white and green damask, with garlands of vine embroidered
back and front, richly spangled in front and enclosing a red rose worked
in bullion and goldsmith&rsquo;s work. Nicander Nucius says that &ldquo;they
consisted of halberdmen and swordsmen who used bucklers and Italian
swords, so that resting the bucklers on the ground, they could discharge
arrows.&rdquo; Perkin Warbeck, posing as the &ldquo;Whyte Rose Prince of
England,&rdquo; had a guard of thirty in &ldquo;Murray and blewe.&rdquo; Henry VIII.
appointed a guard of fifty &ldquo;speeres&rdquo; in the first year of his reign, each
to be attended by an archer, demilaunce, and a custrell, on great horses.
They were so extravagantly dressed, &ldquo;trapped in cloth of golde, silver, and
goldsmithes woorke, and their servants richly appareled also,&rdquo; that &ldquo;they
endured not long the apparell and charges were so greate.&rdquo; They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_60" id="b_Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
not reinstated until the thirty-first year of his reign. Edward VI.&rsquo;s
guard was 400 strong, all very tall, and dressed in crimson velvet
doublets embroidered with golden roses. In meeting Philip of Spain
on his way to Winchester in 1554, Lord Arundel took 100 archers in
yellow cloth striped with red velvet with their bows ready, Mary&rsquo;s
colours, however, being white and green.</p>

<p>The taste for sumptuous armour became definitely fixed on the
accession of Henry VIII. in 1509. Harding relates that, at the Coronation
jousts, Brandon &ldquo;turneyed in harneyes all over gylte from the heade-peece
to the Sabattons.&rdquo; Hall devotes scores of pages to descriptions of
the magnificence of Henry, especially in presence of rival potentates or
their ambassadors. Before Terouenne, the weather being very foul,
Maximilian and his retinue came to the rendezvous in black cloth, but
Henry was attended by a large retinue extravagantly dressed, comprising
his usual &ldquo;nine henxmen&rdquo; in white and crimson cloth of gold richly
embroidered with goldsmith&rsquo;s work, on great coursers as richly caparisoned,
with the addition of many gold bells, and &ldquo;tassels of fyne gold
in bullion&rdquo;&mdash;these bore his helm; &ldquo;the two grangardes,&rdquo; his spears, axe,
etc. He entered Terouenne as a conqueror in &ldquo;armure gilt and graven&rdquo;;
and Maximilian set out on his return &ldquo;toward Almaine in gilte harness,
and his nobles in white harness and rich cotes.&rdquo; On the occasion of the
French ambassador&rsquo;s visit to Greenwich, the king disported himself at
the &ldquo;tilte in a newe harnesse all gilte of a strange fashion that had not
been seen.&rdquo; No less than 286 spears were broken. Charles V. is often
represented in very richly embossed armour, and some of the suits made
for him, such as by the Colmans of Augsburg, show that these sculptured
and pictorial representations were not wholly imaginary.</p>

<p>It is not, however, until the reigns of Mary and Elizabeth that the
culminating point of richness in armour is attained, when poems abound
in allusions to it. In Spenser&rsquo;s <i>Faerie Queen</i> armour always glitters
with gold, and in Camoens&rsquo; <i>Lusiad</i> there are &ldquo;breast-plates flaming
with a thousand dyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of foreign armour the suits of the Dukes of Bourbon and Montmorency
at Wilton are spoils of victory, and others in the Tower and

the country, however, has been acquired by purchase, and of late years.
Of small collections one of the least known is that made by the grandfather
of the Duke of Westminster, who purchased it from Sir Horace
Walpole. The light peascod breast-plate and tassets (<a href="#b_fig22">Fig. 22</a>), richly
engraved and gilt in bands, are probably German of about 1570, and the
gauntlets of approximately the same date, while the close helmet is about
twenty years earlier. The finely engraved and parcel-gilt breast-plate and
tassets (<a href="#b_plate_3">Plate III.</a>) are probably Italian, dating from about 1540. A
deep peascod breast-plate and tassets richly arabesqued with dolphins on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_65" id="b_Page_65">[Pg 65]</a><br /><a name="b_Page_66" id="b_Page_66">[Pg 66]</a><br /><a name="b_Page_67" id="b_Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>

Museum. Very little armour is finer in its way than the breast-plate
(<a href="#b_fig24">Fig. 24</a>) formerly in the Bernal and Londesborough collections. The
repoussé work, designed in the best Italian taste of the sixteenth century,
is enhanced by gold damascening on backgrounds gilt and inlaid with
silver. It is said to have been worn by Philip of Spain, the steel
gauntlets (<a href="#b_fig25">Fig. 25</a>), of similar work, having perhaps formed part of the
same suit. It recalls one in Madrid presented to the Infant Philip III.
by the Duke of Terranova. The finely embossed breast-plate (<a href="#b_plate_5">Plate V.</a>),
and gorget (<a href="#b_fig26">Fig. 26</a>), are French, but unfortunately no history attaches
to them.</p>

<p>This extremely costly armour, with no defensive quality, was intended
for parade rather than use, and an appropriate head-piece was also
especially devised for triumphal display. This was the casque, based
on classic models, which left the face entirely uncovered. Artists of
high renown, like Verrocchio and Pollajuolo, designed and worked upon
these <i>casques d&rsquo;honneur</i>, and the Negrolis, Colmans, and other famous
armourers vied with each other in their production. Superb examples
exist in the great national collections of Europe, but rarely find their way
into private hands. <a href="#b_plate_6">Plate VI.</a>, not one of the finest examples, was formerly
in Lord Londesborough&rsquo;s, and now in Mr. Currie&rsquo;s collection. It has
a triple comb and plume-holder, and is believed to have formed part

a classic-looking helmet with ear-pieces and neck-covering, dear to
Salvator Rosa and his contemporaries. This developed into the spider<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_69" id="b_Page_69">[Pg 69]</a><br /><a name="b_Page_70" id="b_Page_70">[Pg 70]</a><br /><a name="b_Page_71" id="b_Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>

Charles I. and the Commonwealth. <a href="#b_fig27">Fig. 27</a> represents an extremely rich
example of the latter, made with cuirass and gorget in repoussé silver for
Charles II. when prince. The defensive quality of the armet, not being
so purely consecrated to parade, was rarely impaired by embossing, and
even when made for monarchs, the decoration was mainly confined to
etching and gilding. A rare form with double visor, five rope-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_72" id="b_Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
combs, and bands of engraving, is illustrated (<a href="#b_fig28">Fig. 28</a>) from the collection
of Mr. Cozens Smith of Benyeo. The armet continued to be used by
mounted officers until the middle of the seventeenth century, a picture of
Rocroy, 1643, showing Condé in a hat, but his staff in visored helmets.
One of the latest cap-à-pie suits, probably never worn, is that in the
Tower, richly worked and gilded all over, presented to Charles I. by the

<p>The high-combed morions and cabassets of the pikemen and
musketeers are generally richly etched in vertical bands, or covered
with interlacing arabesques, which we gather, from numerous passages in
Brantôme&rsquo;s works, were usually gilt. Thus 4000 harquebuziers stepped
out of the ranks as <i>enfans perdus</i>, at the call of Mons. d&rsquo;Andelet &ldquo;tous
morions gravez et dorez en teste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The buckler or target appears an archaic defence, but survived with
us, sometimes in high favour like the sword, at others nearly obsolete,
until the reign of James I., and in Scotland till recent times. It was
banished while the Spanish rapier and left-handed dagger were in use.</p>

<p>The most magnificent targets were made solely for parade, and were
borne in front of princely personages by their esquires. The broad
surfaces they presented for decoration, and the esteem they were held in,
induced even very great artists, like Giulio Romano, not only to design
them, but actually to work upon them. It is far from rare to find in
collections of drawings by old masters, designs for shields, like those
signed Polydore and B. Franco hanging in the corridors at Chatsworth.
Under the Tudor and later Valois kings they were usually round and
of steel, but sometimes elliptical, obovate, vesica-shaped, rectangular,
and even heater-shaped, with painted arms. One of the finest ever
produced is the Milanese buckler at Windsor, believed to have been
in England since the time of Francis I. The repoussé work is of most
exquisite finish and the gold damascening of extraordinary delicacy.
Others not inferior to it are at Dresden, Turin, and Madrid, the latter
by Colman of Augsburg. The shield of Charles IX. in the Louvre is
also superbly damascened. Magnificent specimens are known from the
hands of the Negrolis and Picinino of Milan, Gasparo Mola of Florence,
Giorgio Ghisi of Mantua. A description of one, now lost, by Hieronymus
Spacini of Milan, states that it comprised forty-eight engravings in<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_73" id="b_Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
gold upon niello. Hans Mielich has left several designs, some of which
were carried out by Colman. The finely-embossed target in the Kensington
Museum is signed by Georgius Sigman of Augsburg. The
Bernal, Meyrick, Soltykoff, and other collections now dispersed, included
examples illustrating the story of Coriolanus, Siege of Troy, Judgment
of Paris, etc.</p>

<p>Those intended to receive the hard knocks of active service must have
presented unembossed surfaces, though perhaps richly etched and gilded
like the morions. The specimen (<a href="#b_fig30">Fig. 30</a>) belonging to Mr. Currie is
rich enough for parade, with its bands of embossing and fine damascening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_74" id="b_Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
while the second illustration (<a href="#b_fig31">Fig. 31</a>) might have been the war target of
an Italian or Spanish Captain under Philip II. It is remarkable that the
first Greenwich inventory only contains eight bucklers, &ldquo;of steele, seven
guilte and wroughte.&rdquo; They were probably somewhat like <a href="#b_fig31">Fig. 31</a>.
Another among the jewels was of silver gilt, with the arms of England,
roses, castles, and pomegranates. This, like the quaint little roundel belonging
to Lord Kenyon (<a href="#b_fig32">Fig. 32</a>), was probably English. It appears that
London bucklers acquired some celebrity in the time of Elizabeth, who
limited the length of their steel points to two inches, for the young King
of Scots greatly desired to possess one. George Brownfelde, Roger
Morgan, Tothill Street, and Richard Hamkyn, King Street, Westminster,
were buckler-makers to Henry VIII.; and Peter Lovat, a Frenchman,
supplied steel pavices at the sign of the cock in Fleet Street at eight
shillings each. They are seldom mentioned as playing a part in actual
warfare, though when Lord Grey de Wilton called for forlorn hopes at
the siege of Guynes, fifty stept out &ldquo;with swordes and roondelles to view
and essaye the breatches.&rdquo; The celebrated Jarnac duel, witnessed by
Henri II., was fought with sword and target.</p>

<p>The chanfron or head-piece to the horse&rsquo;s armour, originally called
the chevron, received as much attention as the helmet or buckler of its
rider. It was the pride of the noble, when Monstrelet wrote, to make
the horse&rsquo;s head-front blaze with jewels. Designs for horse-armour by
Hans Mielich, and that actually executed for Christian II. at Dresden,
are as rich as the suits themselves. The latter illustrates the labours of<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_75" id="b_Page_75">[Pg 75]</a><br /><a name="b_Page_76" id="b_Page_76">[Pg 76]</a><br /><a name="b_Page_77" id="b_Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>

<p>Swords varied considerably in the sixteenth century, the extremes
sometimes meeting in the same army, the two-handed sword, scimitar,
rapier, sabre, cinquedea, falchion, and malchus, being borne perhaps
simultaneously by the mercenary bands comprised in it. The two-handed
sword represents the largest dimensions ever attained by this
weapon, perhaps originating in the sword of state, like that of Edward III.
in Westminster Abbey. It was used in Scotland at an early period; if
not wielded by whole clans, certainly by champions of exceptional vigour.
Thus Froissart relates that Sir Archibald Douglas fought on foot and
wielded an immense sword, the blade of which was two ells long, and so
heavy that scarcely any other man could have lifted it from the ground.
This great sword is the real claymore, though the name has been misappropriated
to the Scottish basket-hilted broadsword of the last century.
The Swiss and Germans were the only people who made it an offensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_78" id="b_Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
weapon for large disciplined bodies of troops, and in the sixteenth
century it had become an essentially Teutonic weapon. Henry VIII.&rsquo;s
great personal strength and agility enabled him to wield it, as a young
man, and to withstand all-comers. The fine hilt illustrated (<a href="#b_fig33">Fig. 33</a>)
from Penshurst, with the pommel and quillons carved and chased out of
the solid steel into the bears and ragged staff of the Leicesters, is undoubtedly
the most beautiful in the country. The blade has been
shortened, perhaps under the edict of Queen Elizabeth, who posted
guards at the City Gates to break all swords that were too long.</p>

has been improperly applied to it since the eighteenth century.
The handles were frequently ivory with pierced brass insertions, like the
illustration (<a href="#b_fig34">Fig. 34</a>), belonging to the Duke of Norfolk; but the finest
examples are of chased steel, exquisitely worked and silvered. The
Cinquedea was highly esteemed in Venice.</p>

<p>Until the introduction of the Spanish rapier the sword used with the
buckler was short and heavy in the blade, though with handles sometimes
richly worked and inlaid with silver. The rapier appeared about 1570
to 1580, the slender tapering blade being relatively of great length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_82" id="b_Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
rendering it difficult to sheathe. The guards to the hilts were generally
of open work, the variety of form, though endless, falling into three
leading groups, the swept-hilted, shell-guard, and cup-hilted, the finest
workmanship being as a rule found on the latter. The quillons, generally
very long, are either straight or curved. With the rapier, a long
dagger held in the left hand and called the <i>main-gauche</i> was used to
parry, the blade being notched near the base to entangle and break the
opponent&rsquo;s weapon. Two varieties are figured, both with superbly chased
hilts; the one of steel belonging to Mr. Percy Macquoid (<a href="#b_fig35">Fig. 35</a>), and
one with silver guard (<a href="#b_fig36">Fig. 36</a>), belonging to Her Majesty. The cup-hilted
rapier (<a href="#b_fig37">Fig. 37</a>), reproduced on a slightly smaller scale, is the
companion to the latter dagger and is also partly silver-hilted and chased
with representations of combats. The quillons are engraved with flowers,
and the blade is signed Heinrich Coell, Solingen. The blades and hilts
were frequently, perhaps usually, made in different workshops. Many of
those in Vienna have German hilts and Italian blades, others have
Solingen blades and Milanese hilts. Toledo blades were, however,
preferred, and their marks were frequently imitated by German makers.
The first ship of the ill-fated Spanish Armada to fall a prey to Drake
and Howard was the <i>Capitana</i> of the Andalusian squadron, which among
its treasures carried a chest of swords, richly mounted, and intended for
presentation to the English Catholic peers. Frequent reference is made
in Elizabethan plays to Bilbao and Toledo blades, but more especially to
&ldquo;Foxes,&rdquo; so called from the Nuremberg mark. Certain passages show
that these were used with the buckler, in this country at least; and in the
engraving of the funeral of Sir Philip Sidney, targets both round and
oval are carried.</p>

<p>The staves, bills, pikes, morris-pikes, holy-water sprinklers, etc.,
played a very important part in war at this period. The halberds and
partisans carried by officers of the harquebusiers, royal guards, and officials
were the vehicles for an immense amount of decoration, especially
throughout the seventeenth century. Albert Dürer, writing from Venice
to Pirkheimer, mentions that the Italian lansquenets &ldquo;have roncoins with
218 points, and if they pink a man with any of these, the man is dead,
as they are all poisoned.&rdquo; This could hardly have been serious, but a
sheet of drawings by Leonardo da Vinci shows some very extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_83" id="b_Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
forms. Most of the varieties of staves were no doubt originally developments
of the peasant scythes, bill-hooks, pitch-forks, and the poll-axe;
each country preserving some peculiar form. The cross-bow had long
ceased to be a military weapon, but was, owing to its silent fire, still in
great repute for sport. It was usually inlaid with ivory, engraved,
sometimes stained and heightened with pearl. A fine specimen in
the Tower is illustrated (<a href="#b_fig38">Fig. 38</a>).</p>

FIREARMS AND GUNLOCKS</h2>

<p class="center"><i>By</i> <span class="smcap">Major</span> V. A. FARQUHARSON</p>


<p>The actual date of the first employment of portable firearms is uncertain,
but representations of them are frequently met with in the illustrated
MSS. of the early part of the fifteenth century, their form at first being
simply a tube fastened to a wooden stock, and, according to the coloured
drawings, the tube was either of brass or iron. The manner of firing
was to apply a match by hand to a touch-hole situated on the upper part
of the barrel. The first improvement was to drill the touch-hole in the
side of the barrel, with the priming held in a pan formed in a projection
also on the side of the barrel, which had a cover, moving on a pivot, thus
protecting the powder from the wet or wind till the moment of firing,
when it was pushed back by hand. This was the general kind of firearm
used during the first half of the fifteenth century. For some time
after their introduction, hand firearms were viewed with disfavour, and
it was considered more or less unfair to employ them, seeing that the
Gothic armour worn by the knights had power to resist the ordinary
weapons of the field, but took no account of the effects of missiles from
the clumsy &ldquo;gonner.&rdquo; That they were in use in 1453 is evident, as the
great Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, buried at Whitchurch, came to his
end from this cause. &ldquo;Though at first with manfull courage and sore
fighting the Earle wanne the entre of their camp, yet at length they
compassed him about, and, <i>shooting him through the thigh with an
hand-gonne</i>, slew his horse and finally killed him lying on the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_85" id="b_Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
whom they never durst look in the face, while he stood on his feet&rdquo;
(Hollinshed&rsquo;s <i>Chronicle</i>). This was at Chatillon, 20th July 1453.</p>

<p>Wheel-lock of blued steel, with gold and silver inlay, and wheel-guard of tracery in thin gold. French, 17th Century.
Collection of Major Farquharson.</p></div>

<p>The first lock was apparently a curved piece of metal in the shape
of an S and pivoted in the centre, the upper point holding the match,
the lower part, which was prolonged like the lever in the cross-bow, by
its weight keeping the match from the pan till this lower part was
compressed to the stock on firing.</p>

<p>The next stage was the matchlock proper. This is the first lock
where the mechanism is complete on a plate. The cock is kept back
by a spring acting on the long arm of a lever, while fastened to the
short end was a sear or trigger. The pan still projects on the side of
the barrel, a principle seen in modern Eastern matchlocks. The next
matchlocks had the pan fixed to and forming part of the plate; later
matchlocks only vary in the shape of the plate. In the reign of William
III. the plates are of the same size as the flint-lock, so that the locks
could be changed when required. The matchlock was altogether in
use for nearly 200 years, owing to its great simplicity and cheapness.
There is a variation of the matchlock in which, by elaborate mechanism,
the match is caused to descend on the priming with a snap-action. It
is difficult to see the advantage to be obtained from this, as the match
it would appear must have broken by contact with the pan, unless it
may have taken the form of a stick of hard composition. The head
of the match-holders in these locks is a short tube, which gives some
probability to this theory, but there is no record to prove it.</p>

<p>The <i>wheel-lock</i> is supposed to have been invented in 1517, although
a lock belonging to the writer has the date of 1509, yet it is not certain
if 1569 is not meant. Nuremberg is reported to be the place of its
invention, where indeed, at the time, most things were claimed to have
been invented; and the city mark is constantly met with on early locks.
It was an important invention, and, except for the delicacy of its
mechanism and great expense of production, it was an efficient lock.
It consisted briefly of a steel wheel, having from two to four grooves
affixed to an axle which passed through the lock-plate, the edge of the
wheel appearing through the bottom of the pan. The outer part of the
axle was square for a key to fit on, and the inner had a shoulder or
crank, which was connected by a shackle chain of three links to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_86" id="b_Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
extremely strong spring. The fire stone (pyrites) was fixed in a holder,
screwed to the farther end of the lock-plate. The pan had a sliding
cover. To put the lock in action a key or &ldquo;spanner&rdquo; was placed on
the outer end of the axle, and given a &frac34; turn; by this the spring was
compressed, and kept at tension by the nose of a sear, connected with
the trigger, entering a small hole on the inner surface of the wheel.
The pan was then primed, the sliding cover brought over it, and the
pyrites holder depressed, bringing the pyrites down on the cover. On
pulling the trigger the wheel revolved, its axle shoulder knocked back
the pan cover and allowed the grooves to grate sparks from the fire-stone,
thus firing the priming. There are numerous variations in the
wheel-lock of all dates and of many nationalities. By the shape of the
feeds, the number of grooves, and by the internal mechanism, and of
course by the ornamentation, a tolerable idea can be got of the date
or origin of a piece. It is remarkable that the earliest locks were more
complete and had appliances that we fail to find in the later. Thus in
<a href="#b_fig40">Fig. 40</a>, a type of the earliest pistol, the lock possesses a safety catch
to prevent premature discharge, also a spring-catch to keep the pan
cover back. Those, which would be thought advantages, are not to
be found in the two examples in <a href="#b_plate_8">Plate VIII.</a> of later date and finer
workmanship. In some cases the wheel winds itself, when the pyrites
holder is drawn back, thus dispensing with a key. This principle is
such an obvious improvement that it seems strange it was not universally
adopted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 40.</span>&mdash;<i>Early German Wheel-lock Pistol, used by the Reiters.
Collection of Major Farquharson.</i></p></div>

<p>A result of the introduction of the wheel-lock was the invention of
pistols, which never carry match-locks. The name may have been
derived from Pistoia in Tuscany, or, as it has been suggested, from the
name of the coin pistole, referring to the bore. There is a word
in Italian <i>pistolese</i>, but it signifies a knife. <a href="#b_fig40">Fig. 40</a> is a good example
of an early pistol. It is of the class used by the Reiters, German
cavalry, the first body of troops armed with pistols. The barrels
at this time are of great thickness, owing to the dread of bursting,
and the stocks sloped abruptly, being terminated by a ball butt. This
was probably to act as a counterpoise, and also to facilitate drawing the
piece from the holster. It would be more efficient, too, when used as a
club, as it very frequently was, according to pictures of the time. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_87" id="b_Page_87">[Pg 87]</a><br /><a name="b_Page_88" id="b_Page_88">[Pg 88]</a><br /><a name="b_Page_89" id="b_Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
early engravings of the Reiter he is armed not only with a pair, but on
occasion with four of these pistols, two in the holsters and two fastened
to his belt by hasps (<a href="#b_fig40">Fig. 40</a> is furnished with a hook or hasp on the
reverse side). The Reiter also had a sword. The introduction of the
pistol altered the tactics of war; the bodies of horse no longer charged
home, but galloped up by ranks, within a few paces of the enemy,
discharged their pistols, and then wheeled outward by half troops towards
each flank, leaving the front clear for the succeeding rank to take their
place. They then reloaded and re-formed ready for another advance.
Many of the earlier pistols were wholly of steel. The smaller pistols
had a flat butt, cut slanting, and were called Dags. In course of time the
barrels were made longer and thinner, the stocks became more straight,
and the ball butt elongated, and finally disappeared. The wheel-lock was
used for pistols up to 1650. Crusoe, in the Instructions for the Cavallerie,
1632, gives some fifteen motions for the &ldquo;firing Exercise&rdquo; of the wheel
pistol.</p>

<p>The Queen possesses a double-barrelled wheel rifle, in which one
barrel was placed vertically over the other, dated 1588. It is fired by
means of two wheel-locks on one plate, in one of which the works are
outside, and the other has them hidden by the plate, the stock is of dark
wood, and the fittings of the locks are of chased and gilt metal. Its
double barrel, date of the rifling, and the fact of its having a steel ramrod,
all make it remarkable. The Dresden arms are on the heel plate, a
cypher HF on the stock, and the barrel has a bear as armourer&rsquo;s mark.</p>

<p>The wheel-lock was rarely used for infantry arms, but was of
necessity employed by cavalry, where the match was inconvenient.</p>

<p>The next form of lock was the <i>Snap-hance</i>, evolved from the wheel-lock
by converting the pyrites holder into a fire-steel, and replacing the
wheel by a hammer, acted on by a spring and affixed to the opposite side
of the pan. The pan and cover remained the same, and the latter
slid back as the hammer fell on the steel, leaving the powder bare for the
sparks to fall on.</p>

<p>The earliest actual lock of this sort is on a pair of pistols in the
Dresden Armoury, dated 1598. The pistols are of the Scotch form, but
are probably of Spanish make, as the Highlanders obtained their firearms
largely from Spain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_90" id="b_Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>The example <a href="#b_fig42">Fig. 42</a> is a snap-hance of Italian make, but of later type
(about 1640). It was selected on account of the beautiful chiselled steel
of which it is composed. This is in three degrees of relief. The hammer
has two dragons entwined on it, and the plate and fire-steel are very
richly fashioned, having the armourer&rsquo;s signature on it, <span class="small">GIOVANNI · VATE ·
BORGOGNONE · IN · BRESCIA</span>. Part of the fire-steel is missing.</p>

<p>The most famous makers of firearms of the middle of the seventeenth
century lived in Brescia, such as Lazarino Cominazzo, father and son,
Lazaro Lazarino, Francino, and others. Their weapons were famed for
extreme lightness and beauty of decoration.</p>

<p>Fig. 39 is a late example of Cominazzo&rsquo;s work. The barrel has a
beautiful fluted twist on it, and the lock-plate and hammer, as well as the
butt, are chiselled in high relief. These armourers made weapons with
each class of lock. It was quite the thing for any one on their grand
tour to visit Brescia, and bring back one of these famed weapons.
Evelyn in his <i>Diary</i> tells us how he paid a visit to &ldquo;old Lazarino
Cominazzo,&rdquo; and got from him a carbine for which he paid a good deal
of money. He seems to have been rather proud of his acquisition, as he
more than once alludes to it.</p>

<p>The Civil War in England showed firearms in use with all four
classes of lock. The infantry on both sides were chiefly armed with the
heavy musket fired from a rest, having the match-lock. The cavalry
had carbines fitted with snap-hances or the early complete flint, or were
provided with wheel-locks.</p>

<p>The wheel-lock disappears from military arms about 1670, but
continued in use in Germany for sporting rifles until a much later date.
The <i>Flint-lock</i> proper came into use about 1630. The earliest specimens
appear to be Spanish. The mainspring in these was on the outside of
the lock-plate, and the mechanism of the simplest character, consisting of
a catch forming a ledge, protruding to the outside of the lock-plate, for
the foot of the hammer to rest on when cocked, and on this ledge being
drawn back on pressing the trigger the hammer falls, striking the steel,
which also covers the pan.</p>

<p>The example <a href="#b_fig43">Fig. 43</a> is one of a class where the ornamentation is very
elaborate. The design is formed mostly by the chisel and hammer, and
even in the internal mechanism the file appears scarcely to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_91" id="b_Page_91">[Pg 91]</a><br /><a name="b_Page_92" id="b_Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
used. Many of these fine locks exist, but never have any armourer&rsquo;s
mark on them; the mechanism, however, points to their Spanish origin.
Works of this description were found in Spanish locks to the latter end
of the eighteenth century. In both English and French flint-locks
the mechanism was on the inside of the lock-plate, and a tumbler
connected the hammer with the action of the mainspring. A later
improvement was to add a bridle to give two bearings for the tumbler
axle, and a small swivel connecting the tumbler with the mainspring,
both of these improvements ensuring greater smoothness in the action.
This form of improved mechanism was continued in the percussion lock,
after the use of a flint was discontinued, and, indeed, the hammer used in
the first military breechloader generally employed in our army, the Snider,
was acted on by mechanism of much the same sort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Figs. 43, 44.</span>&mdash;<i>Highland Pistols. Collection of Major Farquharson.</i></p></div>

<p>Figs. 43 and 44 show specimens of the Highland pistol, a class which
stands quite by itself. These weapons no doubt were evolved from the
early steel wheel dags in common use in Germany. Many Highlanders
were to be found in the armies of other European nations, whence they
probably took the fashion and also procured their firearms. The earliest
weapons of the sort, as well as the latest, were all of steel (or rarely brass).
The stocks had a heart-shaped butt, and were furnished with snap-hance
locks. There is one of this description, undoubtedly a Scotch weapon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_93" id="b_Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
in the armoury in the old castle of Nürnberg, where the arms have always
been stored, belonging probably to one of the many Scotch officers
employed in Germany during the wars of the seventeenth century.
Later on the butt of the pistol assumed a claw form and the ordinary
flint-lock was employed, the mechanism, however, being of a distinctive
sort, possibly of Dutch origin. The latest of these pistols have a rounded
butt as in <a href="#b_fig43">Fig. 44</a>. The ornament found on the back of the hammer in
<a href="#b_fig43">Fig. 43</a> is not to be seen in any other class of lock.</p>

<p>The Highlanders looking at length on their weapons as part of the
equipment of their national garb, a colony of armourers sprang up in
the village of Doune in Stirlingshire, a place where &ldquo;trysts&rdquo; or fairs
were held, and where the Highlanders resorted to exchange their cattle
for other goods. The following account is given in <i>Scottish National
Memorials</i>, of this trade of Doune. &ldquo;The only remains of any of the
ancient branches of trade is the making of Highland pistols. The
reputation of Doune for this manufacture, about the time of the German
war, was very great. This art was introduced to Doune about the year
1646 by Thomas Caddell, who having been instructed in his craft at
Muthil, a village in Strathearn in Perthshire, came and settled at Doune.
This famous tradesman possessed a most profound genius, and an inquisitive
mind, and though a man of no education and remote from every
means of instruction in the mechanical arts, his study and persevering
exertions brought his art to so high a degree of perfection that no
pistols made in Britain excelled or perhaps equalled those of his making
either for sureness, strength, or beauty. He taught the trade to his
children and several apprentices, of whom was one John Campbell,
whose son and grandson carried on the business. While the ancient
dress of Caledonia was worn, that is, the &lsquo;philabeg&rsquo; belted-plaid, pistols,
and dirk, the pistols made in Doune excelled all others, and acquired
superior reputation over France and Germany; a pair superbly ornamented
were fabricated by a tradesman taught in Doune, and by the
city of Glasgow given in compliment to the Marquis de Bouillé. The
above Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s grandson, who has now given over business, made
pistols for the first nobility in Europe, as Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick,
the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick, the Duke of Cumberland, and
others. The trade is now (1798) carried on by John Murdoch (the<span class="pagenum"><a name="b_Page_94" id="b_Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
maker of <a href="#b_fig43">Fig. 44</a>). These pistols were sold (1798) at from four to
twenty-four guineas a pair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The names of some of these armourers were the Caddells, James
Sutherland, Thomas Murdoch, John Murdoch, S. Michie, John Campbell,
J. Stuart, David M&lsquo;Kenzie, and others. The trade died out at the
commencement of this century.</p>

<p>These weapons were remarkable for grace of outline and great lightness.
The butt has a small knob, which, when unscrewed, forms a
picker to clear the touch-hole with. The mainsprings in many cases
appear to be weak, having little room to work in the slender stocks.</p>
